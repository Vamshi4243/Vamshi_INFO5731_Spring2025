            "A chatbot is an intelligent system which can hold a conversation with a human using natural language in real time. Due to the rise of Internet usage, many businesses now use online platforms to handle customer inquiries, and many of them turn to chatbots for improving their customer service or for streamlining operations and increasing their productivity. However, there is still a gap between existing chatbots and the autonomous, conversational agents businesses hope to implement. As such, this paper will first provide an overview of chatbots and then focus on research trends regarding the development of human-like chatbots capable of closing this technological gap. We reviewed the literature published over the past decade, from 1998 to 2018, and presented an overview of chatbots using a mind-map. The research findings suggest that chatbots operate in three steps: understanding the natural language input; generating an automatic, relevant response; and, constructing realistic and fluent natural language responses. The current bottleneck in designing artificially intelligent chatbots lies in the industry’s lack of natural language processing capabilities. Without the ability to properly understand the content and context of a user’s input, the chatbot cannot generate a relevant response.\n",

            "Introduction: Various methods have been implemented to detect adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals. However, the applicability of machine learning methods has not yet been fully evaluated. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of machine learning algorithms in detecting ADR signals of nivolumab and docetaxel, new and old anticancer agents. Methods: We conducted a safety surveillance study of nivolumab and docetaxel using the Korea national spontaneous reporting database from 2009 to 2018. We constructed a novel input dataset for each study drug comprised of known ADRs that were listed in the drug labels and unknown ADRs. Given the known ADRs, we trained machine learning algorithms and evaluated predictive performance in generating safety signals of machine learning algorithms (gradient boosting machine [GBM] and random forest [RF]) compared with traditional disproportionality analysis methods (reporting odds ratio [ROR] and information component [IC]) by using the area under the curve (AUC). Each method then was implemented to detect new safety signals from the unknown ADR datasets. Results: Of all methods implemented, GBM achieved the best average predictive performance (AUC: 0.97 and 0.93 for nivolumab and docetaxel). The AUC achieved by each method was 0.95 and 0.92 (RF), 0.55 and 0.51 (ROR), and 0.49 and 0.48 (IC) for respective drug. GBM detected additional 24 and nine signals for nivolumab and 82 and 76 for docetaxel compared to ROR and IC, respectively, from the unknown ADR datasets. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithm based on GBM performed better and detected more new ADR signals than traditional disproportionality analysis methods.\n",

            "This paper discusses different feature selection methods and CO2 flux data sets with a varying quality‐quantity balance for the application of a Random Forest model to predict daily CO2 fluxes at 250 m spatial resolution for the Rur catchment area in western Germany between 2010 and 2018. Measurements from eddy covariance stations of different ecosystem types, remotely sensed vegetation data from MODIS, and COSMO‐REA6 reanalysis data were used to train the model and predictions were validated by a spatial and temporal validation scheme. Results show the capabilities of a backwards feature elimination to remove irrelevant variables and an importance of high‐quality‐low‐quantity flux data set to improve predictions. However, results also show that spatial prediction is more difficult than temporal prediction by reflecting the mean value accurately though underestimating the variance of CO2 fluxes. Vegetated parts of the catchment acted as a CO2 sink during the investigation period, net capturing about 237 g C m−2 y−1. Croplands, coniferous forests, deciduous forests and grasslands were all sinks on average. The highest uptake was predicted to occur in late spring and early summer, while the catchment was a CO2 source in fall and winter. In conclusion, the Random Forest model predicted a narrower distribution of CO2 fluxes, though our methodological improvements look promising in order to achieve high‐resolution net ecosystem exchange data sets at the regional scale.\n",

            "Abstract Objective To assess the consistency of machine learning and statistical techniques in predicting individual level and population level risks of cardiovascular disease and the effects of censoring on risk predictions. Design Longitudinal cohort study from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2018. Setting and participants 3.6 million patients from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink registered at 391 general practices in England with linked hospital admission and mortality records. Main outcome measures Model performance including discrimination, calibration, and consistency of individual risk prediction for the same patients among models with comparable model performance. 19 different prediction techniques were applied, including 12 families of machine learning models (grid searched for best models), three Cox proportional hazards models (local fitted, QRISK3, and Framingham), three parametric survival models, and one logistic model. Results The various models had similar population level performance (C statistics of about 0.87 and similar calibration). However, the predictions for individual risks of cardiovascular disease varied widely between and within different types of machine learning and statistical models, especially in patients with higher risks. A patient with a risk of 9.5-10.5% predicted by QRISK3 had a risk of 2.9-9.2% in a random forest and 2.4-7.2% in a neural network. The differences in predicted risks between QRISK3 and a neural network ranged between –23.2% and 0.1% (95% range). Models that ignored censoring (that is, assumed censored patients to be event free) substantially underestimated risk of cardiovascular disease. Of the 223 815 patients with a cardiovascular disease risk above 7.5% with QRISK3, 57.8% would be reclassified below 7.5% when using another model. Conclusions A variety of models predicted risks for the same patients very differently despite similar model performances. The logistic models and commonly used machine learning models should not be directly applied to the prediction of long term risks without considering censoring. Survival models that consider censoring and that are explainable, such as QRISK3, are preferable. The level of consistency within and between models should be routinely assessed before they are used for clinical decision making.\n",

We also include text variables related to the type of activity. We compare the predictive performance of three estimation methods: a dynamic Probit model, logistic Lasso regression, and XGBoost algorithm. The results show that the XGBoost algorithm has the highest performance in predicting business failure from a broad dataset. We use SHAP values to interpret the results and identify the main factors of failure. Our analysis shows that both financial and nonfinancial variables are failure factors. Our results confirm the role of financial variables in predicting business failure, while self-employment is the factor that most strongly increases the probability of failure. The size of the SME is also a business failure factor. Our results show that a number of nonfinancial variables, such as localization and economic conditions, are drivers of SME failure. The results also show that certain activities are associated with a prediction of lower failure probability while some activities are associated with a prediction of higher failure.\n",

            "Epidemiological studies on health effects of air pollution usually rely on measurements from monitors, which provide limited spatio-temporal coverage. Data from satellites, reanalysis and chemical transport models offer additional information used to reconstruct pollution concentrations at high spatio-temporal resolution. The aim of this study is to develop a multi-stage satellite-based machine learning model to estimate daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels across Great Britain during 2003-2018. This high-resolution model consists of random forest (RF) algorithms applied in four stages. Stage-1 augmented monitor-PM2.5 series using co-located PM10 measures. Stage-2 imputed missing satellite aerosol optical depth observations using atmospheric reanalysis models. Stage-3 integrates the output from previous stages with spatial and spatio-temporal variables to build a prediction model for PM2.5. Stage-4 applied Stage-3 models to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations over a 1-km grid. The RF architecture performed well in all stages, with results from Stage-3 showing an average cross-validated R2 of 0.788 and minimal bias. Spatial and temporal scale also performed well with R2 of 0.822 and 0.779, respectively. The high spatio-temporal resolution and relatively high precision allows this dataset (1.37 billion points) to be used in epidemiological analyses to assess health risks associated with both short- and long-term exposures to PM2.5.\n",

            "Abstract Objective Determine if deep learning detects sepsis earlier and more accurately than other models. To evaluate model performance using implementation-oriented metrics that simulate clinical practice. Materials and Methods We trained internally and temporally validated a deep learning model (multi-output Gaussian process and recurrent neural network [MGP–RNN]) to detect sepsis using encounters from adult hospitalized patients at a large tertiary academic center. Sepsis was defined as the presence of 2 or more systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria, a blood culture order, and at least one element of end-organ failure. The training dataset included demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, medication administrations, and labs from October 1, 2014 to December 1, 2015, while the temporal validation dataset was from March 1, 2018 to August 31, 2018. Comparisons were made to 3 machine learning methods, random forest (RF), Cox regression (CR), and penalized logistic regression (PLR), and 3 clinical scores used to detect sepsis, SIRS, quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), and National Early Warning Score (NEWS). Traditional discrimination statistics such as the C-statistic as well as metrics aligned with operational implementation were assessed. Results The training set and internal validation included 42 979 encounters, while the temporal validation set included 39 786 encounters. The C-statistic for predicting sepsis within 4 h of onset was 0.88 for the MGP–RNN compared to 0.836 for RF, 0.849 for CR, 0.822 for PLR, 0.756 for SIRS, 0.619 for NEWS, and 0.481 for qSOFA. MGP–RNN detected sepsis a median of 5 h in advance. Temporal validation assessment continued to show the MGP–RNN outperform all 7 clinical risk score and machine learning comparisons. Conclusions We developed and validated a novel deep learning model to detect sepsis. Using our data elements and feature set, our modeling approach outperformed other machine learning methods and clinical scores.\n",

            "In this pandemic situation, importance and awareness about mental health are getting more attention. Stress recognition from multimodal sensor based physiological signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG) signals is a very cost-effective way due to its noninvasive nature. A dataset, recorded during the mental arithmetic task, consisting of EEG + ECG signals of 36 participants is used. It contains two categories of performance, namely, “Good” (nonstressed) and “Bad” (stressed) (Gupta et al. 2018 and Eraldeír et al. 2018). This paper presents an effective approach for the recognition of stress marker at frontal, temporal, central, and occipital lobes. It processes the multimodality physiological signals. The variational mode decomposition (VMD) strategy is used for data preprocessing and for the decomposition of signals into various oscillatory mode functions. Poincare plots (PP) are derived from the first eight variational modes and features from these plots have been extracted such as mean, area, and central tendency measure of the elliptical region. The statistical significance of the extracted features with p < 0.5 has been performed using the Wilcoxson test. The multilayer perceptron (MPLN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms are used for the classification of stress and nonstress categories. MLPN has achieved the maximum accuracies of 100% for frontal and temporal lobes. The suggested method can be incorporated in noninvasive EEG signal processing based automated stress identification systems.\n",

            "This study proposes a hybrid intelligence approach based on an extreme gradient boosting regression and genetic algorithm, namely, the XGBR-GA model, incorporating Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data to estimate the mangrove above-ground biomass (AGB), including small and shrub mangrove patches in the Red River Delta biosphere reserve across the northern coast of Vietnam. We used the novel extreme gradient boosting decision tree (XGBR) technique together with genetic algorithm (GA) optimization for feature selection to construct and verify a mangrove AGB model using data from a field survey of 105 sampling plots conducted in November and December of 2018 and incorporated the dual polarimetric (HH and HV) data of the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band and the Sentinel-2 multispectral data combined with Sentinel-1 (C-band VV and VH) data. We employed the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The capability of the XGBR-GA model was assessed via a comparison with other machine-learning (ML) techniques, i.e., the CatBoost regression (CBR), gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR) models. The XGBR-GA model yielded a promising result (R2 = 0.683, RMSE = 25.08 Mg·ha−1) and outperformed the four other ML models. The XGBR-GA model retrieved a mangrove AGB ranging from 17 Mg·ha−1 to 142 Mg·ha−1 (with an average of 72.47 Mg·ha−1). Therefore, multisource optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) combined with the XGBR-GA model can be used to estimate the mangrove AGB in North Vietnam. The effectiveness of the proposed method needs to be further tested and compared to other mangrove ecosystems in the tropics.\n",

            "OBJECTIVE To construct and internally validate prediction models to estimate the risk of long-term end-organ complications and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity that can be used to inform treatment decisions for patients and practitioners who are considering metabolic surgery. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 2,287 patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent metabolic surgery between 1998 and 2017 in the Cleveland Clinic Health System were propensity-matched 1:5 to 11,435 nonsurgical patients with BMI ≥30 kg/m2 and type 2 diabetes who received usual care with follow-up through December 2018. Multivariable time-to-event regression and random forest machine learning models were built and internally validated using fivefold cross-validation to predict the 10-year risk for four outcomes of interest. The prediction models were programmed to construct user-friendly web-based and smartphone applications of Individualized Diabetes Complications (IDC) Risk Scores for clinical use. RESULTS The prediction tools demonstrated the following discrimination ability based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (1 = perfect discrimination and 0.5 = chance) at 10 years in the surgical and nonsurgical groups, respectively: all-cause mortality (0.79 and 0.81), coronary artery events (0.66 and 0.67), heart failure (0.73 and 0.75), and nephropathy (0.73 and 0.76). When a patient’s data are entered into the IDC application, it estimates the individualized 10-year morbidity and mortality risks with and without undergoing metabolic surgery. CONCLUSIONS The IDC Risk Scores can provide personalized evidence-based risk information for patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity about future cardiovascular outcomes and mortality with and without metabolic surgery based on their current status of obesity, diabetes, and related cardiometabolic conditions.\n",

            " This paper provides an orthogonal extension of the semiparametric difference-in-differences estimator proposed in earlier literature. The proposed estimator enjoys the so-called Neyman orthogonality (Chernozhukov et al., 2018), and thus it allows researchers to flexibly use a rich set of machine learning methods in the first-step estimation. It is particularly useful when researchers confront a high-dimensional data set in which the number of potential control variables is larger than the sample size and the conventional nonparametric estimation methods, such as kernel and sieve estimators, do not apply. I apply this orthogonal difference-in-differences estimator to evaluate the effect of tariff reduction on corruption. The empirical results show that tariff reduction decreases corruption in large magnitude.\n",

            "Objective To determine how machine learning has been applied to prediction applications in population health contexts. Specifically, to describe which outcomes have been studied, the data sources most widely used and whether reporting of machine learning predictive models aligns with established reporting guidelines. Design A scoping review. Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, INSPEC and ACM Digital Library were searched on 18 July 2018. Eligibility criteria We included English articles published between 1980 and 2018 that used machine learning to predict population-health-related outcomes. We excluded studies that only used logistic regression or were restricted to a clinical context. Data extraction and synthesis We summarised findings extracted from published reports, which included general study characteristics, aspects of model development, reporting of results and model discussion items. Results Of 22 618 articles found by our search, 231 were included in the review. The USA (n=71, 30.74%) and China (n=40, 17.32%) produced the most studies. Cardiovascular disease (n=22, 9.52%) was the most studied outcome. The median number of observations was 5414 (IQR=16 543.5) and the median number of features was 17 (IQR=31). Health records (n=126, 54.5%) and investigator-generated data (n=86, 37.2%) were the most common data sources. Many studies did not incorporate recommended guidelines on machine learning and predictive modelling. Predictive discrimination was commonly assessed using area under the receiver operator curve (n=98, 42.42%) and calibration was rarely assessed (n=22, 9.52%). Conclusions Machine learning applications in population health have concentrated on regions and diseases well represented in traditional data sources, infrequently using big data. Important aspects of model development were under-reported. Greater use of big data and reporting guidelines for predictive modelling could improve machine learning applications in population health.

The present study focuses on the analysis of the scientific production and performance of the Machine Learning and Big Data (MLBD) concepts. A bibliometric methodology of scientific mapping has been used, based on processes of estimation, quantification, analytical tracking, and evaluation of scientific research. A total of 4240 scientific publications from the Web of Science (WoS) have been analyzed. Our results show a constant and ascending evolution of the scientific production on MLBD, 2018 and 2019 being the most productive years. The productions are mainly in English language. The topics are variable in the different periods analyzed, where “machine-learning” is the one that shows the greatest bibliometric indicators, it is found in most of motor topics and is the one that offers the greatest line of continuity between the different periods. It can be concluded that research on MLBD is of interest and relevance to the scientific community, which focuses its studies on the branch of machine-learning.\n",

            "Seismicity in the Raton Basin over the past two decades suggests reactivation of basement faults due to waste‐water injection. In the summer of 2018, 96 short period three‐component nodal instruments were installed in a highly active region of the basin for a month. A machine‐learning based phase picker (PhaseNet) was adopted and identified millions of picks, which were associated into events using an automated algorithm—REAL (Rapid Earthquake Association and Location). After hypocenter relocation with hypoDD, the earthquake catalog contains 9,259 ML −2.2 to 3 earthquakes focused at depths of 4–6 km. Magnitude of completeness (Mc) varies from −1 at nighttime to −0.5 in daytime, likely reflecting noise variation modulated by wind. The clustered hypocenters with variable depths and focal mechanisms suggest a complex network of basement faults. Frequency‐magnitude statistics and the spatiotemporal evolution of seismicity are comparable to tectonic systems.\n",

            "Background Central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) occurs frequently in patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), but performing prophylactic central lymph node dissection is still controversial. There are no reliable models for predicting CLNM. This study aimed to develop predictive models for CLNM by machine learning (ML) algorithms. Methods Patients with PTC who underwent initial thyroid resection at our hospital between January 2018 and December 2019 were enrolled. A total of 22 variables, including clinical characteristics and ultrasonography (US) features, were used for conventional univariate and multivariate analysis and to construct ML-based models. A 5-fold cross validation strategy was used for validation and a feature selection approach was applied to identify risk factors. Results The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 7 models ranged from 0.680 to 0.731. All models performed significantly better than US (AUC=0.623) in predicting CLNM (P<0.05). In decision curve, most of the models also performed better than US. The gradient boosting decision tree model with 7 variables was identified as the best model because of its best performance in both ROC (AUC=0.731) and decision curves. Based on multivariate analysis and feature selection, young age, male sex, low serum thyroid peroxidase antibody and US features such as suspected lymph nodes, microcalcification and tumor size > 1.1 cm were the most contributing predictors for CLNM. Conclusions It is feasible to develop predictive models of CLNM in PTC patients by incorporating clinical characteristics and US features. The ML algorithm may be a useful tool for the prediction of lymph node metastasis in thyroid cancer.\n",

An automatic evaluation of this parameter may contribute to the advance of wheat phenotyping and monitoring. There is no standard protocol for wheat ear counting in the field, and moreover it is time-consuming. An automatic ear counting system is proposed using machine learning techniques based on RGB images acquired from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Evaluation was performed on a set of 12 winter wheat cultivars with 3 nitrogen treatments during the 2017-2018 crop season. The automatic system uses a frequency filter, segmentation, and feature extraction with different classification techniques to discriminate wheat ears in micro-plot images. The relationship between the image-based manual counting and the algorithm counting exhibited high accuracy and efficiency. In addition, manual ear counting was conducted in the field for secondary validation. The correlations between the automatic and the manual in-situ ear counting with grain yield were also compared. Correlations between both ear counting systems were strong, particularly for the lower N treatment. Methodological requirements and limitations are discussed.\n",

            "Background: Compared to other genital cancers, cervical cancer is the most prevalent and the main cause of mortality in females in third-world countries, affected by different factors, including smoking, poor nutritional status, immune-deficiency, long-term use of contraceptives and so on. Objective: The present study was conducted to predict cervical cancer and identify its important predictors using machine learning classification algorithms. Material and Methods: In a cross-sectional study, the data of 145 patients with 23 attributes, which referred to Shohada Hospital Tehran, Iran during 2017–2018, were analyzed by machine learning classification algorithms which included SVM, QUEST, C&R tree, MLP and RBF. The criteria measurement used to evaluate these algorithms included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC). Results: The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and AUC of Quest and C&R tree were, respectively 95.55, 90.48, 100, and 95.20, 95.55, 90.48, 100, and 95.20, those of RBF 95.45, 90.00, 100 and 91.50, those of SVM 93.33, 90.48, 95.83 and 95.80 and those of MLP 90.90, 90.00, 91.67 and 91.50 percentage. The important predictors in all the algorithms were found to comprise personal health level, marital status, social status, the dose of contraceptives used, level of education and number of caesarean deliveries. Conclusion: This investigation confirmed that ML can enhance the prediction of cervical cancer. The results of this study showed that Decision Tree algorithms can be applied to identify the most relevant predictors. Moreover, it seems that improving personal health and socio-cultural level of patients can be causing cervical cancer prevention.\n",

            "ABSTRACT Rice is the most important food crop in Taiwan, directly feeding more than 23 million people in the country. Information on rice production is thus crucial for crop management and food policymaking. This study aims to develop a machine learning (ML) approach for predicting rice crop yields in Taiwan using time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. We processed the data for the period from 2000 to 2018, following three main steps: (1) data pre-processing to generate smooth time-series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, (2) establishment of models for yield predictions using the heading date (HD) NDVI value, and the accumulated NDVI value of the dates from heading to maturity (DHM). The data from 2000 to 2017 were used for building predictive models using the random forests (RF) and support vector machines (SVM), leaving the 2018 data for model assessment, and (3) evaluation of model performance. The results compared with the government’s yield statistics indicated good predictions, with the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) values between 7.1% and 11.8%, and Willmott’s index of agreement (d) values between 0.81 and 0.84 for the first crop, and 5.6% and 11.3% and d values between 0.91 and 0.95 for the second crop, respectively. A slight underestimation of yield predictions was observed for both crops, with the relative error (RE) values of −6.5% to −8.2% and −3.8% to −6% for the first and second crops, respectively. The results of regression analysis also confirmed a close agreement between these two datasets, with the correlation coefficient (r) higher than 0.84 (p-value <0.05), in both cases. Although some factors, including mixed-pixel issues, boundary effects, and cloud cover potentially affected the modelling results, our study demonstrated the effectiveness of ML methods for regional rice yield predictions from MODIS NDVI data in Taiwan.\n",

            "The expected growth in air travel demand and the positive correlation with the economic factors highlight the significant contribution of the aviation community to the U.S. economy. On‐time operations play a key role in airline performance and passenger satisfaction. Thus, an accurate investigation of the variables that cause delays is of major importance. The application of machine learning techniques in data mining has seen explosive growth in recent years and has garnered interest from a broadening variety of research domains including aviation. This study employed a support vector machine (SVM) model to explore the non-linear relationship between flight delay outcomes. Individual flight data were gathered from 20 days in 2018 to investigate causes and patterns of air traffic delay at three major New York City airports. Considering the black box characteristic of the SVM, a sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the relationship between dependent and explanatory variables. The impacts of various explanatory variables are examined in relation to delay, weather information, airport ground operation, demand-capacity, and flow management characteristics. The variable impact analysis reveals that factors such as pushback delay, taxi-out delay, ground delay program, and demand-capacity imbalance with the probabilities of 0.506, 0.478, 0.339, and 0.338, respectively, are significantly associated with flight departure delay. These findings provide insight for better understanding of the causes of departure delays and the impacts of various explanatory factors on flight delay patterns.\n",

            "The increased reliance on the Internet and the corresponding surge in connectivity demand has led to a significant growth in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The continued deployment of IoT devices has in turn led to an increase in network attacks due to the larger number of potential attack surfaces as illustrated by the recent reports that IoT malware attacks increased by 215.7% from 10.3 million in 2017 to 32.7 million in 2018. This illustrates the increased vulnerability and susceptibility of IoT devices and networks. Therefore, there is a need for proper effective and efficient attack detection and mitigation techniques in such environments. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as one potential solution due to the abundance of data generated and available for IoT devices and networks. Hence, they have significant potential to be adopted for intrusion detection for IoT environments. To that end, this paper proposes an optimized ML-based framework consisting of a combination of Bayesian optimization Gaussian Process (BO-GP) algorithm and decision tree (DT) classification model to detect attacks on IoT devices in an effective and efficient manner. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using the Bot-IoT-2018 dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed optimized framework has a high detection accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness for the detection of botnet attacks in IoT environments.\n",

            "Soybean plant density is an important factor of successful agricultural production. Due to the high number of plants per unit area, early plant overlapping and eventual plant loss, the estimation of soybean plant density in the later stages of development should enable the determination of the final plant number and reflect the state of the harvest. In order to assess soybean plant density in a digital, nondestructive, and less intense way, analysis was performed on RGB images (containing three channels: RED, GREEN, and BLUE) taken with a UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) on 66 experimental plots in 2018, and 200 experimental plots in 2019. Mean values of the R, G, and B channels were extracted for each plot, then vegetation indices (VIs) were calculated and used as predictors for the machine learning model (MLM). The model was calibrated in 2018 and validated in 2019. For validation purposes, the predicted values for the 200 experimental plots were compared with the real number of plants per unit area (m2). Model validation resulted in the correlation coefficient—R = 0.87, mean absolute error (MAE) = 6.24, and root mean square error (RMSE) = 7.47. The results of the research indicate the possibility of using the MLM, based on simple values of VIs, for the prediction of plant density in agriculture without using human labor.\n",

A comprehensive cybercrime study by Ponemon Institute highlights that malware is the most expensive attack for organizations, with an average revenue loss of $2.6 million per organization in 2018 (11% increase compared to 2017). Recent high-profile malware attacks coupled with serious economic implications have dramatically changed our perception of threat from malware. Software-based solutions, such as anti-virus programs, are not effective since they rely on matching patterns (signatures) that can be easily fooled by carefully crafted malware with obfuscation or other deviation capabilities. Moreover, software-based solutions are not fast enough for real-time malware detection in safety-critical systems. In this paper, we investigate promising approaches for hardware-assisted malware detection using machine learning. Specifically, we explore how machine learning can be effective for malware detection utilizing hardware performance counters, embedded trace buffer as well as on-chip network traffic analysis.\n",

            "Background In recent years, both suicide and overdose rates have been increasing. Many individuals who struggle with opioid use disorder are prone to suicidal ideation; this may often result in overdose. However, these fatal overdoses are difficult to classify as intentional or unintentional. Intentional overdose is difficult to detect, partially due to the lack of predictors and social stigmas that push individuals away from seeking help. These individuals may instead use web-based means to articulate their concerns. Objective This study aimed to extract posts of suicidality among opioid users on Reddit using machine learning methods. The performance of the models is derivative of the data purity, and the results will help us to better understand the rationale of these users, providing new insights into individuals who are part of the opioid epidemic. Methods Reddit posts between June 2017 and June 2018 were collected from r/suicidewatch, r/depression, a set of opioid-related subreddits, and a control subreddit set. We first classified suicidal versus nonsuicidal languages and then classified users with opioid usage versus those without opioid usage. Several traditional baselines and neural network (NN) text classifiers were trained using subreddit names as the labels and combinations of semantic inputs. We then attempted to extract out-of-sample data belonging to the intersection of suicide ideation and opioid abuse. Amazon Mechanical Turk was used to provide labels for the out-of-sample data. Results Classification results were at least 90% across all models for at least one combination of input; the best classifier was convolutional neural network, which obtained an F1 score of 96.6%. When predicting out-of-sample data for posts containing both suicidal ideation and signs of opioid addiction, NN classifiers produced more false positives and traditional methods produced more false negatives, which is less desirable for predicting suicidal sentiments. Conclusions Opioid abuse is linked to the risk of unintentional overdose and suicide risk. Social media platforms such as Reddit contain metadata that can aid machine learning and provide information at a personal level that cannot be obtained elsewhere. We demonstrate that it is possible to use NNs as a tool to predict an out-of-sample target with a model built from data sets labeled by characteristics we wish to distinguish in the out-of-sample target.\n",

Amorphous carbon (a-C) materials have diverse interesting and useful properties, but the understanding of their atomic-scale structures is still incomplete. Here, we report on extensive atomistic simulations of the deposition and growth of a-C films, describing interatomic interactions using a machine learning (ML) based Gaussian approximation potential model. We expand widely on our initial work [M. A. Caro, Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 166101 (2018)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.120.166101] by now considering a broad range of incident ion energies, thus modeling samples that span the entire range from low-density (sp2-rich) to high-density (sp3-rich, \"diamondlike\") amorphous forms of carbon. Two different mechanisms are observed in these simulations, depending on the impact energy: low-energy impacts induce sp- and sp2-dominated growth directly around the impact site, whereas high-energy impacts induce peening. Furthermore, we propose and apply a scheme for computing the anisotropic elastic properties of the a-C films. Our work provides fundamental insight into this intriguing class of disordered solids, as well as a conceptual and methodological blueprint for simulating the atomic-scale deposition of other materials with ML driven molecular dynamics.\n",

            "Crime prediction is of great significance to the formulation of policing strategies and the implementation of crime prevention and control. Machine learning is the current mainstream prediction method. However, few studies have systematically compared different machine learning methods for crime prediction. This paper takes the historical data of public property crime from 2015 to 2018 from a section of a large coastal city in the southeast of China as research data to assess the predictive power between several machine learning algorithms. Results based on the historical crime data alone suggest that the LSTM model outperformed KNN, random forest, support vector machine, naive Bayes, and convolutional neural networks. In addition, the built environment data of points of interests (POIs) and urban road network density are input into LSTM model as covariates. It is found that the model with built environment covariates has better prediction effect compared with the original model that is based on historical crime data alone. Therefore, future crime prediction should take advantage of both historical crime data and covariates associated with criminological theories. Not all machine learning algorithms are equally effective in crime prediction.\n",

            "This paper discusses the use of Random Forest (RF), a popular Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, to perform spatially explicit nowcasting of cloud-to-ground lightning occurrence. An application to the Italian territory and the surrounding seas is then presented. Specifically, a dataset including eighteen geo-environmental features has been used to forecast 1-hour ahead lightning occurrence over a three-months period (August- October 2018). The features' importance resulting from the best RF model showed how data-driven models are able to identify relationships between variables, in agreement with previous physically-based knowledge of the phenomenon. The encouraging results obtained in terms of forecasting accuracy suggest how, after proper improvements, ML-based algorithms could find their place in wider early-warning systems to support disaster risk management procedures.\n",

            "Advances in nextgeneration sequencing (NGS) platforms are allowing researchers to routinely collate large genomewide data sets to address a variety of ecological questions. However, with this big data comes big analytical challenges that are increasingly addressed using machine learning (for a review, see Schrider & Kern, 2018). Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence and represents a conglomeration of methods where predictive accuracy is the primary goal (e.g., Belcaid & Toonen, 2015; Breiman, 2001; Elith et al., 2008; Lucas, 2020). Machine learning assumes that the datagenerating process is unknown and complex and finds the dominant patterns by learning the relationships between inputs and responses (Elith et al., 2008). Broadly, machine learning differs from other statistical approaches in two important ways. The first is that predictive performance drives model formulation rather than model selection or expert opinion, and the second is there is less emphasis on model selection ( Breiman, 2001; Lucas, 2020). For these reasons, machine learning has the reputation for being less interpretable and difficult to apply rigorously (Elith et al., 2008; Lucas, 2020; Molnar, 2018). However, in parallel with the revolution of sequencing techniques, there has also been a revolution in data science in terms of predictive performance and techniques to interpret machine learning models (FountainJones et al., 2019; Lucas, 2020; Molnar, 2018). There are now streamlined R and Python packages that make the robust use of algorithms from support vector machines (SVMs) to neural networks readily achievable (e.g., Abadi et al., 2015; Kuhn & Wickham, 2020, see Text Box 1 for some important machine learning terminology). Moreover, other statistical paradigms such as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) are being applied sidebyside or within machine learning frameworks to enhance the utility of these approaches (e.g., Carlson, 2020; Raynal et al., 2019). The ability of machine learning algorithms to build powerful predictive models that capture complex nonlinear responses with minimal statistical assumptions has been harnessed by most molecular ecology subdisciplines for decades. For example, machine learning models were developed before the turn of the millennium to classify normal or cancerous tissue based on transcription profiles (Furey et al., 2000). Not long after gradient boosting models (GBMs) were developed (e.g., Hastie et al., 2009), researchers were applying the approach to classify population genetics models based on a suite of summary statistics such as Tajima's θπ (Lin et al., 2011). In addition, extensions of the popular random forest algorithm have been utilized in ecological genetics to untangle the drivers of climate adaptation (Fitzpatrick & Keller, 2015). Generally, however, advances in computer science and machine learning are slow to filter down to ecologists (Belcaid & Toonen, 2015; Elith & Hastie, 2008; FountainJones et al., 2019), partly through unfamiliarity with these types of approaches but also because of the rapid rate of advance in the data science field. This Special Issue aims to help expand the use of machine learning approaches and to help bring advances in data science to the toolkits of molecular ecologists. This issue comprises 17 papers grouped into four sections covering a diverse variety of molecular ecology subdisciplines. The first section covers how machine learning can be applied to make inferences about population demography. We further group these papers algorithmically with four papers utilizing random forest architecture and the remaining four using neural networks. The second section highlights how machine learning can detect signatures of selection across loci. The third section highlights how these methods can be applied to untangle the complex ecological drivers of genomic change (‘ecological genomics’) and species community dynamics. The last section explores how advances in machine learning can provide insights into species limits and contribute to biodiversity monitoring.\n",

            "High frequency and spatially explicit irrigated land maps are important for understanding the patterns and impacts of consumptive water use by agriculture. We built annual, 30 m resolution irrigation maps using Google Earth Engine for the years 1986–2018 for 11 western states within the conterminous U.S. Our map classifies lands into four classes: irrigated agriculture, dryland agriculture, uncultivated land, and wetlands. We built an extensive geospatial database of land cover from each class, including over 50,000 human-verified irrigated fields, 38,000 dryland fields, and over 500,000 km 2 of uncultivated lands. We used 60,000 point samples from 28 years to extract Landsat satellite imagery, as well as climate, meteorology, and terrain data to train a Random Forest classifier. Using a spatially independent validation dataset of 40,000 points, we found our classifier has an overall binary classification (irrigated vs. unirrigated) accuracy of 97.8%, and a four-class overall accuracy of 90.8%. We compared our results to Census of Agriculture irrigation estimates over the seven years of available data and found good overall agreement between the 2832 county-level estimates (r 2 = 0.90), and high agreement when estimates are aggregated to the state level (r 2 = 0.94). We analyzed trends over the 33-year study period, finding an increase of 15% (15,000 km 2 ) in irrigated area in our study region. We found notable decreases in irrigated area in developing urban areas and in the southern Central Valley of California and increases in the plains of eastern Colorado, the Columbia River Basin, the Snake River Plain, and northern California.\n",

            "Background The growing awareness of cardiovascular toxicity from cancer therapies has led to the emerging field of cardio‐oncology, which centers on preventing, detecting, and treating patients with cardiac dysfunction before, during, or after cancer treatment. Early detection and prevention of cancer therapy–related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) play important roles in precision cardio‐oncology. Methods and Results This retrospective study included 4309 cancer patients between 1997 and 2018 whose laboratory tests and cardiovascular echocardiographic variables were collected from the Cleveland Clinic institutional electronic medical record database (Epic Systems). Among these patients, 1560 (36%) were diagnosed with at least 1 type of CTRCD, and 838 (19%) developed CTRCD after cancer therapy (de novo). We posited that machine learning algorithms can be implemented to predict CTRCDs in cancer patients according to clinically relevant variables. Classification models were trained and evaluated for 6 types of cardiovascular outcomes, including coronary artery disease (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC], 0.821; 95% CI, 0.815–0.826), atrial fibrillation (AUROC, 0.787; 95% CI, 0.782–0.792), heart failure (AUROC, 0.882; 95% CI, 0.878–0.887), stroke (AUROC, 0.660; 95% CI, 0.650–0.670), myocardial infarction (AUROC, 0.807; 95% CI, 0.799–0.816), and de novo CTRCD (AUROC, 0.802; 95% CI, 0.797–0.807). Model generalizability was further confirmed using time‐split data. Model inspection revealed several clinically relevant variables significantly associated with CTRCDs, including age, hypertension, glucose levels, left ventricular ejection fraction, creatinine, and aspartate aminotransferase levels. Conclusions This study suggests that machine learning approaches offer powerful tools for cardiac risk stratification in oncology patients by utilizing large‐scale, longitudinal patient data from healthcare systems.\n",

            "Objective Medication adherence plays a key role in type 2 diabetes (T2D) care. Identifying patients with high risks of non-compliance helps individualized management, especially for China, where medical resources are relatively insufficient. However, models with good predictive capabilities have not been studied. This study aims to assess multiple machine learning algorithms and screen out a model that can be used to predict patients’ non-adherence risks. Methods A real-world registration study was conducted at Sichuan Provincial People’s Hospital from 1 April 2018 to 30 March 2019. Data of patients with T2D on demographics, disease and treatment, diet and exercise, mental status, and treatment adherence were obtained by face-to-face questionnaires. The medication possession ratio was used to evaluate patients’ medication adherence status. Fourteen machine learning algorithms were applied for modeling, including Bayesian network, Neural Net, support vector machine, and so on, and balanced sampling, data imputation, binning, and methods of feature selection were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We use two-way cross-validation to ensure the accuracy of model evaluation, and we performed a posteriori test on the sample size based on the trend of AUC as the sample size increase. Results A total of 401 patients out of 630 candidates were investigated, of which 85 were evaluated as poor adherence (21.20%). A total of 16 variables were selected as potential variables for modeling, and 300 models were built based on 30 machine learning algorithms. Among these algorithms, the AUC of the best capable one was 0.866±0.082. Imputing, oversampling and larger sample size will help improve predictive ability. Conclusions An accurate and sensitive adherence prediction model based on real-world registration data was established after evaluating data filling, balanced sampling, and so on, which may provide a technical tool for individualized diabetes care.\n",

            "The timely reporting of critical results in radiology is paramount to improved patient outcomes. Artificial intelligence has the ability to improve quality by optimizing clinical radiology workflows. We sought to determine the impact of a United States Food and Drug Administration-approved machine learning (ML) algorithm, meant to mark computed tomography (CT) head examinations pending interpretation as higher probability for intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), on metrics across our healthcare system. We hypothesized that ML is associated with a reduction in report turnaround time (RTAT) and length of stay (LOS) in emergency department (ED) and inpatient populations.\n",

            "Background Patient flow directly affects quality of care, access and financial performance for hospitals. Multidisciplinary discharge-focused rounds have proven to minimise avoidable delays experienced by patients near discharge. The study objective was to support discharge-focused rounds by implementing a machine-learning-based discharge prediction model using real-time electronic health record (EHR) data. We aimed to evaluate model predictive performance and impact on hospital length-of-stay. Methods Discharge prediction models were developed from hospitalised patients on four inpatient units between April 2016 and September 2018. Unit-specific models were implemented to make individual patient predictions viewable with the EHR patient track board. Predictive performance was measured prospectively for 12 470 patients (120 780 patient-predictions) across all units. A pre/poststudy design applying interrupted time series methods was used to assess the impact of the discharge prediction model on hospital length-of-stay. Results Prospective discharge prediction performance ranged in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.70 to 0.80 for same-day and next-day predictions; sensitivity was between 0.63 and 0.83 and specificity between 0.48 and 0.80. Elapsed length-of-stay, counts of labs and medications, mobility assessments and measures of acute kidney injury were model features providing the most predictive value. Implementing the discharge predictions resulted in a reduction in hospital length-of-stay of over 12 hours on a medicine unit (p<0.001) and telemetry unit (p=0.002), while no changes were observed for the surgery unit (p=0.190) and second medicine unit (p<0.555). Conclusions Incorporating automated patient discharge predictions into multidisciplinary rounds can support decreases in hospital length-of-stay. Variation in execution and impact across inpatient units existed.\n",

            "Hypotensive events in the initial stage of anesthesia can cause serious complications in the patients after surgery, which could be fatal. In this study, we intended to predict hypotension after tracheal intubation using machine learning and deep learning techniques after intubation one minute in advance. Meta learning models, such as random forest, extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and deep learning models, especially the convolutional neural network (CNN) model and the deep neural network (DNN), were trained to predict hypotension occurring between tracheal intubation and incision, using data from four minutes to one minute before tracheal intubation. Vital records and electronic health records (EHR) for 282 of 319 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy from October 2018 to July 2019 were collected. Among the 282 patients, 151 developed post-induction hypotension. Our experiments had two scenarios: using raw vital records and feature engineering on vital records. The experiments on raw data showed that CNN had the best accuracy of 72.63%, followed by random forest (70.32%) and Xgboost (64.6%). The experiments on feature engineering showed that random forest combined with feature selection had the best accuracy of 74.89%, while CNN had a lower accuracy of 68.95% than that of the experiment on raw data. Our study is an extension of previous studies to detect hypotension before intubation with a one-minute advance. To improve accuracy, we built a model using state-of-art algorithms. We found that CNN had a good performance, but that random forest had a better performance when combined with feature selection. In addition, we found that the examination period (data period) is also important.\n",

            "The financial crisis that hit Ghana from 2015 to 2018 has raised various issues with respect to the efficiency of banks and the safety of depositors’ in the banking industry. As part of measures to improve the banking sector and also restore customers’ confidence, efficiency and performance analysis in the banking industry has become a hot issue. This is because stakeholders have to detect the underlying causes of inefficiencies within the banking industry. Nonparametric methods such as Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) have been suggested in the literature as a good measure of banks’ efficiency and performance. Machine learning algorithms have also been viewed as a good tool to estimate various nonparametric and nonlinear problems. This paper presents a combined DEA with three machine learning approaches in evaluating bank efficiency and performance using 444 Ghanaian bank branches, Decision Making Units (DMUs). The results were compared with the corresponding efficiency ratings obtained from the DEA. Finally, the prediction accuracies of the three machine learning algorithm models were compared. The results suggested that the decision tree (DT) and its C5.0 algorithm provided the best predictive model. It had 100% accuracy in predicting the 134 holdout sample dataset (30% banks) and a P value of 0.00. The DT was followed closely by random forest algorithm with a predictive accuracy of 98.5% and a P value of 0.00 and finally the neural network (86.6% accuracy) with a P value 0.66. The study concluded that banks in Ghana can use the result of this study to predict their respective efficiencies. All experiments were performed within a simulation environment and conducted in R studio using R codes.\n",

In this review, we start with an introduction to ML by providing an overview of the ML landscape, its general workflow, and the most commonly used algorithms for clinical laboratory applications. Furthermore, we aim to illustrate recent evolutions (2018 to mid-2020) of the techniques used in the clinical laboratory setting and discuss the associated challenges and opportunities. In the field of clinical chemistry, the reviewed applications of ML algorithms include quality review of lab results, automated urine sediment analysis, disease or outcome prediction from routine laboratory parameters, and interpretation of complex biochemical data. In the hematology subdiscipline, we discuss the concepts of automated blood film reporting and malaria diagnosis.

            "Oceanic and coastal ecosystems have undergone complex environmental changes in recent years, amid a context of climate change. These changes are also reflected in the dynamics of water-borne diseases as some of the causative agents of these illnesses are ubiquitous in the aquatic environment and their survival rates are impacted by changes in climatic conditions. Previous studies have established strong relationships between essential climate variables and the coastal distribution and seasonal dynamics of the bacteria Vibrio cholerae, pathogenic types of which are responsible for human cholera disease. In this study we provide a novel exploration of the potential of a machine learning approach to forecast environmental cholera risk in coastal India, home to more than 200 million inhabitants, utilising atmospheric, terrestrial and oceanic satellite-derived essential climate variables. A Random Forest classifier model is developed, trained and tested on a cholera outbreak dataset over the period 2010–2018 for districts along coastal India. The random forest classifier model has an Accuracy of 0.99, an F1 Score of 0.942 and a Sensitivity score of 0.895, meaning that 89.5% of outbreaks are correctly identified. Spatio-temporal patterns emerged in terms of the model’s performance based on seasons and coastal locations. Further analysis of the specific contribution of each Essential Climate Variable to the model outputs shows that chlorophyll-a concentration, sea surface salinity and land surface temperature are the strongest predictors of the cholera outbreaks in the dataset used. The study reveals promising potential of the use of random forest classifiers and remotely-sensed essential climate variables for the development of environmental cholera-risk applications. Further exploration of the present random forest model and associated essential climate variables is encouraged on cholera surveillance datasets in other coastal areas affected by the disease to determine the model’s transferability potential and applicative value for cholera forecasting systems.\n",

Significant differences in the recipients' age, diabetes status, HBsAg level, operation time, reoperation, usage of anti-fungal drugs, preoperative albumin and immunoglobulin levels, preoperative pulmonary lesions, and delayed graft function, as well as donor age, were observed between patients with and without severe pneumonia (P<0.05). We screened eight important features correlated with severe pneumonia using the recursive feature elimination method and then constructed a predictive model based on these features. The top three features were preoperative pulmonary lesions, reoperation and recipient age (with importance scores of 0.194, 0.124 and 0.078, respectively). Among the machine learning algorithms described above, the Random Forest algorithm displayed better predictive performance, with a sensitivity of 0.67, specificity of 0.97, positive likelihood ratio of 22.33, negative likelihood ratio of 0.34, AUROC of 0.91, and AUPRC of 0.72.\n",

According to Scopus (www2.scopus.com), the number of publications in medicine with machine learning in the title, abstract, or as a keyword during 2016 to 2018 increased from 1658 to 3904. In psychiatry, applications of machine learning are proposed to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and prognosis and determine treatment choice. At the same time, much of this research has given insufficient attention to high-quality methods, clinical applications, and ethical aspects. This is compounded by poor reporting of performative measures and misleading claims about the high accuracy of such approaches. In this issue of JAMA Psychiatry, the article by Gradus and colleagues 1 raises important questions about the place of machine learning in research and practice. Machine learning is useful when analyzing several predictors, particularly if there are nonlinear observations and interaction terms that are difficult to theoretically conceptualize and practically model. A strength of the study by Gradus et al1 is that it uses a robust data set of patient-level predictors from Danish national health care registers without imposing or relying on theoretical models. The authors tested 1365 parameters based on 334 individual predictors, which were mostly associated with somatic and psychiatric diagnoses and by temporal proximity with the suicide event by being categorized into 4 points of 6, 12, 24, and 48 months. Another strength is the outcome of death by suicide. As the study illuminates risk factors rather than prediction, this is important, as risk factors for suicide are different from self-harm and suicidal ideation. For example, male sex is more highly associated with\n",

            "Crop growth modeling and yield forecasting are essential to improve food security policies worldwide. To estimate potato (Solanum tubersum L.) yield over Mexico at a municipal level, we used meteorological data provided by the ERA5 (ECMWF Re-Analysis) dataset developed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, satellite imagery from the TERRA platform, and field information. Five different machine learning algorithms were used to build the models: random forest (rf), support vector machine linear (svmL), support vector machine polynomial (svmP), support vector machine radial (svmR), and general linear model (glm). The optimized models were tested using independent data (2017 and 2018) not used in the training and optimization phase (2004–2016). In terms of percent root mean squared error (%RMSE), the best results were obtained by the rf algorithm in the winter cycle using variables from the first three months of the cycle (R2 = 0.757 and %RMSE = 18.9). For the summer cycle, the best performing model was the svmP which used the first five months of the cycle as variables (R2 = 0.858 and %RMSE = 14.9). Our results indicated that adding predictor variables of the last two months before the harvest did not significantly improved model performances. These results demonstrate that our models can predict potato yield by analyzing the yield of the previous year, the general conditions of NDVI, meteorology, and information related to the irrigation system at a municipal level.\n",

            "Objective Medication adherence is crucial in the management of Crohn’s disease (CD), and yet the adherence remains low. This study aimed to develop machine learning models that can help predict CD patients of nonadherence to azathioprine (AZA), and thus assist caregivers to streamline the intervention process. Methods This single-centered, cross-sectional study recruited 446 CD patients who have been prescribed AZA between Sep 2005 and Sep 2018. Questionnaires of medication adherence, anxiety and depression, beliefs of medication necessity and concerns, and medication knowledge were provided to patients, while other data were extracted from the electronic medical records. Two machine learning models of back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM) were developed and compared with logistic regression (LR), and assessed by accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results The average classification accuracy and AUC of the three models were 81.6% and 0.896 for LR, 85.9% and 0.912 for BPNN, and 87.7% and 0.930 for SVM, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified four risk factors associated with AZA nonadherence: medication concern belief (OR=3.130, p<0.001), education (OR=2.199, p<0.001), anxiety (OR=1.549, p<0.001) and depression (OR=1.190, p<0.001), while medication necessity belief (OR=0.004, p<0.001) and medication knowledge (OR=0.805, p=0.013) were protective factors. Conclusion We developed three machine learning models and proposed an SVM model with promising accuracy in the prediction of AZA nonadherence in Chinese CD patients. The study also reconfirmed that education, psychologic distress, and medication beliefs and knowledge are correlated to AZA nonadherence.\n",

            "Background and Aims: The aim of this study was to analyse the landscape of publications on rectal cancer (RC) over the past 25 years by machine learning and semantic analysis. Methods: Publications indexed in PubMed under the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) term ‘Rectal Neoplasms’ from 1994 to 2018 were downloaded in September 2019. R and Python were used to extract publication date, MeSH terms and abstract from the metadata of each publication for bibliometric assessment. Latent Dirichlet allocation was applied to analyse the text from the articles’ abstracts to identify more specific research topics. Louvain algorithm was used to establish a topic network resulting in identifying the relationship between the topics. Results: A total of 23,492 papers published were identified and analysed in this study. The changes of research focus were analysed by the changing of MeSH terms. Studied contents extracted from the publications were divided into five areas, including surgical intervention, radiotherapy and chemotherapy intervention, clinical case management, epidemiology and cancer risk as well as prognosis studies. Conclusions: The number of publications indexed on RC has expanded rapidly over the past 25 years. Studies on RC have mainly focused on five areas. However, studies on basic research, postoperative quality of life and cost-effective research were relatively lacking. It is predicted that basic research, inflammation and some other research fields might become the potential hotspots in the future.\n",

            "We introduce the FCHL19 representation for atomic environments in molecules or condensed-phase systems. Machine learning models based on FCHL19 are able to yield predictions of atomic forces and energies of query compounds with chemical accuracy on the scale of milliseconds. FCHL19 is a revision of our previous work [F. A. Faber et al., J. Chem. Phys. 148, 241717 (2018)] where the representation is discretized and the individual features are rigorously optimized using Monte Carlo optimization. Combined with a Gaussian kernel function that incorporates elemental screening, chemical accuracy is reached for energy learning on the QM7b and QM9 datasets after training for minutes and hours, respectively. The model also shows good performance for non-bonded interactions in the condensed phase for a set of water clusters with a mean absolute error (MAE) binding energy error of less than 0.1 kcal/mol/molecule after training on 3200 samples. For force learning on the MD17 dataset, our optimized model similarly displays state-of-the-art accuracy with a regressor based on Gaussian process regression. When the revised FCHL19 representation is combined with the operator quantum machine learning regressor, forces and energies can be predicted in only a few milliseconds per atom. The model presented herein is fast and lightweight enough for use in general chemistry problems as well as molecular dynamics simulations.\n",

Methods: Various machine learning techniques: Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and Random Forest have been applied to correlate air pollutants and COVID-19 fatalities in Delhi. Furthermore, a comparison between the concentration of various air pollutants and the air quality index during the lockdown period and last two years, 2018 and 2019, has been presented. Results: From the experimental work, it has been observed that the pollutants ozone and toluene have increased during the lockdown period. It has also been deduced that the pollutants that may impact the mortalities due to COVID-19 are ozone, NH3, NO2, and PM10. Conclusions: The novel coronavirus has led to environmental restoration due to lockdown. However, there is a need to impose measures to control ozone pollution, as there has been a significant increase in its concentration and it also impacts the COVID-19 mortality rate.\n",

Despite this progress to date, the application of time series analysis has remained underexplored due to complexity of the underlying techniques. In this study, we have deployed a novel ML, called automated time series (AutoTS) machine learning, to automate data processing and the application of a multitude of models to assess which best forecasts future values. This rapid experimentation allows for and enables the selection of the most accurate model in order to perform time series predictions. By using the nation-wide ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision) dataset of hospitalized patients of Romania, we have generated time series datasets over the period of 2008–2018 and performed highly accurate AutoTS predictions for the ten deadliest diseases. Forecast results for the years 2019 and 2020 were generated on a NUTS 2 (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) regional level. This is the first study to our knowledge to perform time series forecasting of multiple diseases at a regional level using automated time series machine learning on a national ICD-10 dataset. The deployment of AutoTS technology can help decision makers in implementing targeted national health policies more efficiently.\n",

            "The study proposes Secondary Precipitation Estimate Merging using Machine Learning (SPEM2L) algorithms for merging multiple global precipitation datasets to improve the spatiotemporal rainfall characterization. SPEM2L is applied over the Krishna River Basin (KRB), India for 34 years spanning from 1985 to 2018, using daily measurements from three Secondary Precipitation Products (SPPs). Sixteen Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) were applied on three SPPs under four combinations to integrate and test the performance of MLAs for accurately representing the rainfall patterns. The individual SPPs and the integrated products were validated against a gauge-based gridded dataset provided by the Indian Meteorological Department. The validation was applied at different temporal scales and various climatic zones by employing continuous and categorical statistics. Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network with Bayesian Regularization (NBR) algorithm employing three SPPs integration outperformed all other Machine Learning Models (MLMs) and two dataset integration combinations. The merged NBR product exhibited improvements in terms of continuous and categorical statistics at all temporal scales as well as in all climatic zones. Our results indicate that the SPEM2L procedure could be successfully used in any other region or basin that has a poor gauging network or where a single precipitation product performance is ineffective.\n",

            "Background Methylphenidate, a stimulant used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, has the potential to be used nonmedically, such as for studying and recreation. In an era when many people actively use social networking services, experience with the nonmedical use or side effects of methylphenidate might be shared on Twitter. Objective The purpose of this study was to analyze tweets about the nonmedical use and side effects of methylphenidate using a machine learning approach. Methods A total of 34,293 tweets mentioning methylphenidate from August 2018 to July 2019 were collected using searches for “methylphenidate” and its brand names. Tweets in a randomly selected training dataset (6860/34,293, 20.00%) were annotated as positive or negative for two dependent variables: nonmedical use and side effects. Features such as personal noun, nonmedical use terms, medical use terms, side effect terms, sentiment scores, and the presence of a URL were generated for supervised learning. Using the labeled training dataset and features, support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were built and the performance was evaluated using F1 scores. The classifiers were applied to the test dataset to determine the number of tweets about nonmedical use and side effects. Results Of the 6860 tweets in the training dataset, 5.19% (356/6860) and 5.52% (379/6860) were about nonmedical use and side effects, respectively. Performance of SVM classifiers for nonmedical use and side effects, expressed as F1 scores, were 0.547 (precision: 0.926, recall: 0.388, and accuracy: 0.967) and 0.733 (precision: 0.920, recall: 0.609, and accuracy: 0.976), respectively. In the test dataset, the SVM classifiers identified 361 tweets (1.32%) about nonmedical use and 519 tweets (1.89%) about side effects. The proportion of tweets about nonmedical use was highest in May 2019 (46/2624, 1.75%) and December 2018 (36/2041, 1.76%). Conclusions The SVM classifiers that were built in this study were highly precise and accurate and will help to automatically identify the nonmedical use and side effects of methylphenidate using Twitter.\n",

            "Opioids play a critical role in acute postoperative pain management. Our objective was to develop machine learning models to predict postoperative opioid requirements in patients undergoing ambulatory surgery. To develop the models, we used a perioperative dataset of 13,700 patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing ambulatory surgery between the years 2016–2018. The data, comprising of patient, procedure and provider factors that could influence postoperative pain and opioid requirements, was randomly split into training (80%) and validation (20%) datasets. Machine learning models of different classes were developed to predict categorized levels of postoperative opioid requirements using the training dataset and then evaluated on the validation dataset. Prediction accuracy was used to differentiate model performances. The five types of models that were developed returned the following accuracies at two different stages of surgery: 1) Prior to surgery—Multinomial Logistic Regression: 71%, Naïve Bayes: 67%, Neural Network: 30%, Random Forest: 72%, Extreme Gradient Boost: 71% and 2) End of surgery—Multinomial Logistic Regression: 71%, Naïve Bayes: 63%, Neural Network: 32%, Random Forest: 72%, Extreme Gradient Boost: 70%. Analyzing the sensitivities of the best performing Random Forest model showed that the lower opioid requirements are predicted with better accuracy (89%) as compared with higher opioid requirements (43%). Feature importance (% relative importance) of model predictions showed that the type of procedure (15.4%), medical history (12.9%) and procedure duration (12.0%) were the top three features contributing to model predictions. Overall, the contribution of patient and procedure features towards model predictions were 65% and 35% respectively. Machine learning models could be used to predict postoperative opioid requirements in ambulatory surgery patients and could potentially assist in better management of their postoperative acute pain.\n",

            "In 1983, Meese and Rogoff showed that traditional economic models developed since the 1970s do not perform better than the random walk in predicting out-of-sample exchange rates when using data obtained after the beginning of the floating rate system. Subsequently, whether traditional economical models can ever outperform the random walk in forecasting out-of-sample exchange rates has received scholarly attention. Recently, a combination of fundamental models with machine learning methodologies was found to outcompete the predictability of random walk (Amat et al. 2018). This paper focuses on combining modern machine learning methodologies with traditional economic models and examines whether such combinations can outperform the prediction performance of random walk without drift. More specifically, this paper applies the random forest, support vector machine, and neural network models to four fundamental theories (uncovered interest rate parity, purchase power parity, the monetary model, and the Taylor rule models). We performed a thorough robustness check using six government bonds with different maturities and four price indexes, which demonstrated the superior performance of fundamental models combined with modern machine learning in predicting future exchange rates in comparison with the results of random walk. These results were examined using a root mean squared error (RMSE) and a Diebold–Mariano (DM) test. The main findings are as follows. First, when comparing the performance of fundamental models combined with machine learning with the performance of random walk, the RMSE results show that the fundamental models with machine learning outperform the random walk. In the DM test, the results are mixed as most of the results show significantly different predictive accuracies compared with the random walk. Second, when comparing the performance of fundamental models combined with machine learning, the models using the producer price index (PPI) consistently show good predictability. Meanwhile, the consumer price index (CPI) appears to be comparatively poor in predicting exchange rate, based on its poor results in the RMSE test and the DM test.\n",

            "Abstract Objective Accurate prediction of vaginal birth after cesarean is crucial for selecting women suitable for a trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC). We sought to develop a machine learning (ML) model for prediction of TOLAC success and to compare its accuracy with that of the MFMU model. Methods All consecutive singleton TOLAC deliveries from a tertiary academic medical center between February 2017 and December 2018 were included. We developed models using the following ML algorithms: random forest (RF), regularized regression (GLM), and eXtreme gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost). For developing the ML models, we disaggregated BMI into height and weight. Similarly, we disaggregated prior arrest of progression into prior arrest of dilatation and prior arrest of descent. We applied a nested cross-validation approach, using 100 random splits of the data to training (80%, 792 samples) and testing sets (20%, 197 samples). We used the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) as a measure of accuracy. Results Nine hundred and eighty-nine TOLAC deliveries were included in the analysis with an observed TOLAC success rate of 85.6%. The AUC-PR in the RF, XGBoost and GLM models were 0.351 0.028, 0.350 0.028 and 0.336 0.024, respectively, compared to 0.325 0.067 for the MFMU-C. The algorithms performed significantly better than the MFMU-C (p-values = .0002, .0004, .0393 for RF, XGBoost, GLM respectively). In the XGBoost model, eight variables were sufficient for accurate prediction. In all ML models, previous vaginal delivery and height were among the three most important predictors of TOLAC success. Prior arrest of descent contributed to prediction more than prior arrest of dilatation, maternal height contributed more than weight. Conclusion All ML models performed significantly better than the MFMU-C. In the XGBoost model, eight variables were sufficient for accurate prediction. Prior arrest of descent and maternal height contribute to prediction more than prior arrest of dilation and maternal weight.\n",

            "Terrorist attacks affect the confidence and security of citizens; it is a violent form of a political struggle that ends in the destruction of order. In the current decade, along with the growth of social networks, terrorist attacks around the world are still ongoing and have had potential growth in recent years. Consequently, it is necessary to identify where the attacks were committed and where is the possible area for an attack. The objective is to provide assertive solutions to these events. As a solution, this research focuses on one of the branches of artificial intelligence (AI), which is the Automatic Learning, also called Machine Learning. The idea is to use AI techniques to visualize and predict possible terrorist attacks using classification models, the decision trees, and the Random Forest. The input would be a database that has a systematic record of worldwide terrorist attacks from 1970 to the last recorded year, which is 2018. As a final result, it is necessary to know the number of terrorist attacks in the world, the most frequent types of attacks and the number of seizures caused by region; furthermore, to be able to predict what kind of terrorist attack will occur and in which areas of the world. Finally, this research aims to help the scientific community use artificial intelligence to provide various types of solutions related to global events.\n",

            "This study aimed to construct an optimal algorithm for initial dose settings of vancomycin (VCM) using machine learning (ML) with decision tree (DT) analysis. Patients who were administered intravenous VCM and underwent therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) at the Hokkaido University Hospital were enrolled. The study period was November 2011 to March 2019. In total, 654 patients were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups, training (patients who received VCM from November 2011 to December 2017; n = 496) and testing (patients who received VCM from January 2018 to March 2019; n = 158) groups. For the training group, DT analysis of the classification and regression tree algorithm was performed to construct an algorithm (called DT algorithm) for the initial dose settings of VCM. For the testing group, the rates of attaining the VCM therapeutic range (trough value = 10-15 and 10-20 mg/L) with the DT algorithm and three conventional dose-setting methods were compared for model evaluation. The DT algorithm was constructed to be used for patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥50 mL/min and body weight ≥40 kg. As a result, the recommended daily doses ranged from 20.0 to 58.1 mg/kg. In model evaluation, the DT algorithm obtained the highest rates of attaining the VCM therapeutic range compared to conventional dose-setting methods. Therefore, our DT algorithm can be applied to clinical practice. In addition, ML is useful for setting drug doses.\n",

            "Background and Aims At present, there is a lack of simple and reliable model for early prediction of the efficacy of etanercept in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). This study aimed to generate and validate prediction models of etanercept efficacy in patients with JIA before administration using machine learning algorithms based on electronic medical record (EMR). Materials and Methods EMR data of 87 JIA patients treated with etanercept between January 2011 and December 2018 were collected retrospectively. The response of etanercept was evaluated by using DAS44/ESR-3 simplified standard. The stepwise forward and backward method based on information gain was applied to select features. Five machine learning algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Extremely Random Trees (ET) and Logistic Regression (LR) were used for model generation and validation with fifty-fold stratified cross-validation. EMR data of additional 14 patients were collected for external validation of the model. Results Tender joint count (TJC), Time interval, Lymphocyte percentage (LYM), and Weight were screened out and included in the final model. The model generated by the XGBoost algorithm based on the above 4 features had the best predictive performance: sensitivity 75%, specificity 66.67%, accuracy 72.22%, AUC 79.17%, respectively. Conclusion A pre-administration model with good prediction performance for etanercept response in JIA was developed using advanced machine learning algorithms. Clinicians and pharmacists can use this simple and accurate model to predict etanercept response of JIA early and avoid treatment failure or adverse effects.\n",

            "Background Twitter presents a valuable and relevant social media platform to study the prevalence of information and sentiment on vaping that may be useful for public health surveillance. Machine learning classifiers that identify vaping-relevant tweets and characterize sentiments in them can underpin a Twitter-based vaping surveillance system. Compared with traditional machine learning classifiers that are reliant on annotations that are expensive to obtain, deep learning classifiers offer the advantage of requiring fewer annotated tweets by leveraging the large numbers of readily available unannotated tweets. Objective This study aims to derive and evaluate traditional and deep learning classifiers that can identify tweets relevant to vaping, tweets of a commercial nature, and tweets with provape sentiments. Methods We continuously collected tweets that matched vaping-related keywords over 2 months from August 2018 to October 2018. From this data set of tweets, a set of 4000 tweets was selected, and each tweet was manually annotated for relevance (vape relevant or not), commercial nature (commercial or not), and sentiment (provape or not). Using the annotated data, we derived traditional classifiers that included logistic regression, random forest, linear support vector machine, and multinomial naive Bayes. In addition, using the annotated data set and a larger unannotated data set of tweets, we derived deep learning classifiers that included a convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) network, LSTM-CNN network, and bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network. The unannotated tweet data were used to derive word vectors that deep learning classifiers can leverage to improve performance. Results LSTM-CNN performed the best with the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.98) for relevance, all deep learning classifiers including LSTM-CNN performed better than the traditional classifiers with an AUC of 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-0.99) for distinguishing commercial from noncommercial tweets, and BiLSTM performed the best with an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.78-0.89) for provape sentiment. Overall, LSTM-CNN performed the best across all 3 classification tasks. Conclusions We derived and evaluated traditional machine learning and deep learning classifiers to identify vaping-related relevant, commercial, and provape tweets. Overall, deep learning classifiers such as LSTM-CNN had superior performance and had the added advantage of requiring no preprocessing. The performance of these classifiers supports the development of a vaping surveillance system.\n",

            "Many low-cost sensors (LCSs) are distributed for air monitoring without any rigorous calibrations. This work applies machine learning with PM2.5 from Taiwan monitoring stations to conduct in-field corrections on a network of 39 PM2.5 LCSs from July 2017 to December 2018. Three candidate models were evaluated: Multiple linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). The model-corrected PM2.5 levels were compared with those of GRIMM-calibrated PM2.5. RFR was superior to MLR and SVR in its correction accuracy and computing efficiency. Compared to SVR, the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of RFR were 35% and 85% lower for the training and validation sets, respectively, and the computational speed was 35 times faster. An RFR with 300 decision trees was chosen as the optimal setting considering both the correction performance and the modeling time. An RFR with a nighttime pattern was established as the optimal correction model, and the RMSEs were 5.9 ± 2.0 μg/m3, reduced from 18.4 ± 6.5 μg/m3 before correction. This is the first work to correct LCSs at locations without monitoring stations, validated using laboratory-calibrated data. Similar models could be established in other countries to greatly enhance the usefulness of their PM2.5 sensor networks.\n",

            "The quick sepsis-related organ failure assessment (qSOFA) score has been introduced to predict the likelihood of organ dysfunction in patients with suspected infection. We hypothesized that machine-learning models using qSOFA variables for predicting three-day mortality would provide better accuracy than the qSOFA score in the emergency department (ED). Between January 2016 and December 2018, the medical records of patients aged over 18 years with suspected infection were retrospectively obtained from four EDs in Korea. Data from three hospitals (n = 19,353) were used as training-validation datasets and data from one (n = 4234) as the test dataset. Machine-learning algorithms including extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting machine, and random forest were used. We assessed the prediction ability of machine-learning models using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve, and DeLong’s test was used to compare AUROCs between the qSOFA scores and qSOFA-based machine-learning models. A total of 447,926 patients visited EDs during the study period. We analyzed 23,587 patients with suspected infection who were admitted to the EDs. The median age of the patients was 63 years (interquartile range: 43–78 years) and in-hospital mortality was 4.0% (n = 941). For predicting three-day mortality among patients with suspected infection in the ED, the AUROC of the qSOFA-based machine-learning model (0.86 [95% CI 0.85–0.87]) for three -day mortality was higher than that of the qSOFA scores (0.78 [95% CI 0.77–0.79], p < 0.001). For predicting three-day mortality in patients with suspected infection in the ED, the qSOFA-based machine-learning model was found to be superior to the conventional qSOFA scores.\n",

However, in agriculture, price volatility is often unpredictable due to the reliability of agricultural production on natural phenomena. Instability of prices endanger the development of Malaysia's economy and the food accessibility by consumers, which may lead to food insecurity, hunger and malnutrition. Thus, the need of an accurate forecasting model for agricultural commodity price is acute, especially for government and farmers to propose new policies and better plantation plan to deal with potential risks in the markets. In the context of forecasting, optimal lag selection is important to improve the forecast performance in terms of time and accuracy. The main goal of this research is to study and design novel machine learning strategies with optimal lag time selection function to forecast agricultural commodity price more accurately in order to improve plantation plan in Malaysia.\n",

            "Objective To build a model for proximal junctional kyphosis (PJK) prognostication in Lenke 5 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients undergoing long posterior instrumentation and fusion surgery by machine learning and analyze the risk factors for PJK. Materials and Methods In total, 44 AIS patients (female/male: 34/10; PJK/non-PJK: 34/10) who met the inclusion criteria between January 2013 and December 2018 were retrospectively recruited from West China Hospital. Thirty-seven clinical and radiological features were acquired by two independent investigators. Univariate analyses between PJK and non-PJK groups were carried out. Twelve models were built by using four types of machine learning algorithms in conjunction with two oversampling methods [the synthetic minority technique (SMOTE) and random oversampling]. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used for model discrimination, and the clinical utility was evaluated by using F1 score and accuracy. The risk factors were simultaneously analyzed by a Cox regression and machine learning. Results Statistical differences between PJK and non-PJK groups were as follows: gender (p = 0.001), preoperative factors [thoracic kyphosis (p = 0.03), T1 slope angle (T1S, p = 0.078)], and postoperative factors [T1S (p = 0.097), proximal junctional angle (p = 0.003), upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) – UIV + 1 (p = 0.001)]. Random forest using SMOTE achieved the best prediction performance with AUC = 0.944, accuracy = 0.909, and F1 score = 0.667 on independent testing dataset. Cox model revealed that male gender and larger preoperative T1S were independent prognostic factors of PJK (odds ratio = 10.701 and 57.074, respectively). Gender was also at the first place in the importance ranking of the model with best performance. Conclusion The random forest using SMOTE model has the great value for predicting the individual risk of developing PJK after long instrumentation and fusion surgery in Lenke 5 AIS patients. Moreover, the combination of the outcomes of a Cox model and the feature ranking extracted by machine learning is more valuable than any one alone, especially in the interpretation of risk factors.\n",

            "The concentration of surface ozone (O3) strongly depends on environmental and meteorological variables through a series of complex and non-linear functions. This study aims to explore the performances of an advanced machine learning (ML) method, the boosted regression trees (BRT) technique, in exploring the relationships between surface O3 and its driving factors, and in predicting the levels of O3 concentrations. To this end, a BRT model was trained on hourly data of air pollutants and meteorological parameters, acquired, over the 2016–2018 period, in a rural area affected by an anthropic source of air pollutants. The abilities of the BRT model in ranking, visualizing, and predicting the relationship between ground-level O3 concentrations and its driving factors were analyzed and illustrated. A comparison with a multiple linear regression (MLR) model was performed based on several statistical indicators. The results obtained indicated that the BRT model was able to account for 81% of changes in O3 concentrations; it slightly outperforms the MLR model in terms of the predictions accuracy and allows a better identification of the main factors influencing O3 variability on a local scale. This knowledge is expected to be useful in defining effective measures to prevent and/or mitigate the health damages associated with O3 exposure.\n",

            "To analyze quantum many-body Hamiltonians, recently, machine learning techniques have been shown to be quite useful and powerful. However, the applicability of such machine learning solvers is still limited. Here, we propose schemes that make it possible to apply machine learning techniques to analyze fermion-boson coupled Hamiltonians and to calculate excited states. As for the extension to fermion-boson coupled systems, we study the Holstein model as a representative of the fermion-boson coupled Hamiltonians. We show that the machine-learning solver achieves highly accurate ground-state energy, improving the accuracy substantially compared to that obtained by the variational Monte Carlo method. As for the calculations of excited states, we propose a different approach than that proposed in K. Choo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 121 (2018) 167204. We discuss the difference in detail and compare the accuracy of two methods using the one-dimensional $S=1/2$ Heisenberg chain. We also show the benchmark for the frustrated two-dimensional $S=1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model and show an excellent agreement with the results obtained by the exact diagonalization. The extensions shown here open a way to analyze general quantum many-body problems using machine learning techniques.\n",

            "ABSTRACT Machine learning is a category of AI technology that is utilized in the product development cycle in numerous industries. It was reported that machine learning can be applied to predict the chemical properties of functional materials, for example, the self-assembly of surfactant solutions (Nanoscale, 2018, 10, 16013) and the chemical reactions of copper nanoparticles (ACS Energy Lett., 2018, 3, 2983). A liquid crystal (LC) molecule is a representative functional material. Monodisperse systems have been targeted in many theoretical studies; however, the resulting products usually have a polydisperse distribution. It has been reported in several studies that the properties exhibited by polydisperse systems are different from those observed in monodisperse systems. In this study, we focus on the physical properties of polydisperse systems i.e. the ratio of binary LC molecules on the phase transition temperature and the possibility of predicting the physical properties of the system using machine learning. A relatively high prediction accuracy was obtained using machine learning. This study demonstrates that machine learning can be utilized to predict the phase transition temperature of polydispersed LC systems. The results of this study will contribute to the further development of material science and molecular design via the application of machine learning. Graphical Abstract\n",

            "Background Timely, precise, and localized surveillance of nonfatal events is needed to improve response and prevention of opioid-related problems in an evolving opioid crisis in the United States. Records of naloxone administration found in prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) data have helped estimate opioid overdose incidence, including nonhospital, field-treated cases. However, as naloxone is often used by EMS personnel in unconsciousness of unknown cause, attributing naloxone administration to opioid misuse and heroin use (OM) may misclassify events. Better methods are needed to identify OM. Objective This study aimed to develop and test a natural language processing method that would improve identification of potential OM from paramedic documentation. Methods First, we searched Denver Health paramedic trip reports from August 2017 to April 2018 for keywords naloxone, heroin, and both combined, and we reviewed narratives of identified reports to determine whether they constituted true cases of OM. Then, we used this human classification as reference standard and trained 4 machine learning models (random forest, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and L1-regularized logistic regression). We selected the algorithm that produced the highest area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for model assessment. Finally, we compared positive predictive value (PPV) of the highest performing machine learning algorithm with PPV of searches of keywords naloxone, heroin, and combination of both in the binary classification of OM in unseen September 2018 data. Results In total, 54,359 trip reports were filed from August 2017 to April 2018. Approximately 1.09% (594/54,359) indicated naloxone administration. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement regarding OM in the narrative, 57.6% (292/516) were considered to include information revealing OM. Approximately 1.63% (884/54,359) of all trip reports mentioned heroin in the narrative. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 95.5% (784/821) were considered to include information revealing OM. Combined results accounted for 2.39% (1298/54,359) of trip reports. Among trip reports with reviewer agreement, 77.79% (907/1166) were considered to include information consistent with OM. The reference standard used to train and test machine learning models included details of 1166 trip reports. L1-regularized logistic regression was the highest performing algorithm (AUC=0.94; 95% CI 0.91-0.97) in identifying OM. Tested on 5983 unseen reports from September 2018, the keyword naloxone inaccurately identified and underestimated probable OM trip report cases (63 cases; PPV=0.68). The keyword heroin yielded more cases with improved performance (129 cases; PPV=0.99). Combined keyword and L1-regularized logistic regression classifier further improved performance (146 cases; PPV=0.99). Conclusions A machine learning application enhanced the effectiveness of finding OM among documented paramedic field responses. This approach to refining OM surveillance may lead to improved first-responder and public health responses toward prevention of overdoses and other opioid-related problems in US communities.\n",

            "In this study, a machine learning algorithm for generating a gridded CONUS-wide probabilistic road temperature forecast is presented. A random forest is used to tie a combination of HRRR model surface variables and information about the geographic location and time of day per year to observed road temperatures. This approach differs from its predecessors in that road temperature is not deterministic (i.e., provides a forecast of a specific road temperature), but rather it is probabilistic, providing a 0%–100% probability that the road temperature is subfreezing. This approach can account for the varying controls on road temperature that are not easily known or able to be accounted for in physical models, such as amount of traffic, road composition, and differential shading by surrounding buildings and terrain. The algorithm is trained using road temperature observations from one winter season (October 2016–March 2017) and calibrated/evaluated using observations from the following winter season (October 2017–March 2018). Case-study analyses show the algorithm performs well for various scenarios and captures the temporal and spatial evolution of the probability of subfreezing roads reliably. Statistical evaluation for the predicted probabilities shows good skill as the mean area under the receiver operating characteristics curve is 0.96 and the Brier skill score is 0.66 for a 2-h forecast and only degrades slightly as lead time is increased. Additionally, the algorithm produces well-calibrated probabilities, and consistent discrimination between clearly above-freezing and subfreezing environments.\n",

            "Land surface temperature (LST) is an important indicator for assessing the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect. This paper presents a novel approach to derive LST estimates by integrating machine learning algorithm and spatiotemporal fusion model at high spatial and temporal resolution. The spatial resolutions of Landsat TM and Landsat 8 LST data were first downscaled using random forest (RF) algorithm from 120 m and 100 m, respectively, to 30 m. The resultant LST data were fused with MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data, by means of the Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion method (FSDAF), in order to generate high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST data covering the center of Chengdu city in China. The proposed new method was used to estimate the spatiotemporal variations of the summer daytime SUHI from 2009 to 2018 over Chengdu city. Results show that: (1) RF performs way better than the classical downscaling algorithm—thermal sharpening algorithm (TsHARP) for LST, and produces higher accuracy for different land covers; (2) the fused high spatiotemporal resolution summer daytime LST values were evaluated with in situ LST obtained from Chengdu Meteorological Office and the final validation results indicated that the proposed method, in generating LST dataset, can provide more details of urban thermal environment and produce higher accuracy than the traditional FSDAF; (3) significantly increasing trends of summer daytime SUHI intensity (SUHII) in the study area were observed. SUHII increased from 2.78 °C in 2009 to 4.04 °C in 2018. The highest and lowest summer daytime LST estimates were recorded over impervious surface area (ISA) and waters, respectively.\n",

            "This Special Issue of the IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science (TPS) follows the first American Physical Society Division of Plasma Physics (APS-DPP) mini-conference on Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence in Plasma Research held during the 60th APS-DPP Meeting in Portland, OR, USA (November 5–9, 2018). It contains selected highlights from not only the mini-conference but also the broader plasma physics community. Although data science has a long and rich history in plasma physics, dating back at least three decades, it is experiencing a renaissance, thanks in large part to the advances outside of plasma physics. Novel algorithms, hardware, and analytic techniques (buoyed by the open source software ecosystem) have led plasma scientists to explore ways in which the data revolution could accelerate and inform scientific discovery. Emerging data-driven methods could have a transformative effect across the full spectrum of plasma research. For fusion energy research, some areas of opportunities [item 1) in the Appendix] include using machine learning (ML) or data methods for scientific discoveries, augmented instrumentation, accelerated model development and simulations, data-informed intelligent controls of the experiment, and data-enhanced predictions. The DPP mini-conference and the articles herein represent only a tiny cross section of contemporary research on data-driven plasma science. The 3rd International Conference on Data-Driven Plasma Science (ICDDPS-3) will be held in Okinawa, Japan, in April 2020 [item 2) in the Appendix], with expected presentations on fusion plasmas and low-temperature plasmas and beyond. Furthermore, Plasma Science is not unique in its exploration of Scientific Machine Learning: the Second Workshop on Machine Learning and the Physical Sciences (NeurIPS 2019, Vancouver, BC, Canada, December 2019) and it illustrates a trend in cross disciplinary collaboration with contributions from plasma research.\n",

            "Background Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most severe form of tuberculosis, but differentiating between the diagnosis of TBM and viral meningitis (VM) is difficult. Thus, we have developed machine-learning modules for differentiating TBM from VM. Material and Methods For the training data, confirmed or probable TBM and confirmed VM cases were retrospectively collected from five teaching hospitals in Korea between January 2000 - July 2018. Various machine-learning algorithms were used for training. The machine-learning algorithms were tested by the leave-one-out cross-validation. Four residents and two infectious disease specialists were tested using the summarized medical information. Results The training study comprised data from 60 patients with confirmed or probable TBM and 143 patients with confirmed VM. Older age, longer symptom duration before the visit, lower serum sodium, lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose, higher CSF protein, and CSF adenosine deaminase were found in the TBM patients. Among the various machine-learning algorithms, the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics of artificial neural network (ANN) with ImperativeImputer for matrix completion (0.85; 95% confidence interval 0.79 - 0.89) was found to be the highest. The AUC of the ANN model was statistically higher than those of all the residents (range 0.67 - 0.72, P <0.001) and an infectious disease specialist (AUC 0.76; P = 0.03). Conclusion The machine-learning techniques may play a role in differentiating between TBM and VM. Specifically, the ANN model seems to have better diagnostic performance than the non-expert clinician.\n",

            "Background Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) systems are incorporated into clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to reduce medication errors and improve patient safety. Automatic alerts generated from CDSSs can directly assist physicians in making useful clinical decisions and can help shape prescribing behavior. Multiple studies reported that approximately 90%-96% of alerts are overridden by physicians, which raises questions about the effectiveness of CDSSs. There is intense interest in developing sophisticated methods to combat alert fatigue, but there is no consensus on the optimal approaches so far. Objective Our objective was to develop machine learning prediction models to predict physicians’ responses in order to reduce alert fatigue from disease medication–related CDSSs. Methods We collected data from a disease medication–related CDSS from a university teaching hospital in Taiwan. We considered prescriptions that triggered alerts in the CDSS between August 2018 and May 2019. Machine learning models, such as artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), naïve Bayes (NB), gradient boosting (GB), and support vector machine (SVM), were used to develop prediction models. The data were randomly split into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets. Results A total of 6453 prescriptions were used in our model. The ANN machine learning prediction model demonstrated excellent discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] 0.94; accuracy 0.85), whereas the RF, NB, GB, and SVM models had AUROCs of 0.93, 0.91, 0.91, and 0.80, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the ANN model were 0.87 and 0.83, respectively. Conclusions In this study, ANN showed substantially better performance in predicting individual physician responses to an alert from a disease medication–related CDSS, as compared to the other models. To our knowledge, this is the first study to use machine learning models to predict physician responses to alerts; furthermore, it can help to develop sophisticated CDSSs in real-world clinical settings.\n",

            "Summary Objectives: To select, present, and summarize the most relevant papers published in 2018 and 2019 in the field of Ontologies and Knowledge Representation, with a particular focus on the intersection between Ontologies and Machine Learning. Methods: A comprehensive review of the medical informatics literature was performed to select the most interesting papers published in 2018 and 2019 and that document the utility of ontologies for computational analysis, including machine learning. Results: Fifteen articles were selected for inclusion in this survey paper. The chosen articles belong to three major themes: (i) the identification of phenotypic abnormalities in electronic health record (EHR) data using the Human Phenotype Ontology ; (ii) word and node embedding algorithms to supplement natural language processing (NLP) of EHRs and other medical texts; and (iii) hybrid ontology and NLP-based approaches to extracting structured and unstructured components of EHRs. Conclusion: Unprecedented amounts of clinically relevant data are now available for clinical and research use. Machine learning is increasingly being applied to these data sources for predictive analytics, precision medicine, and differential diagnosis. Ontologies have become an essential component of software pipelines designed to extract, code, and analyze clinical information by machine learning algorithms. The intersection of machine learning and semantics is proving to be an innovative space in clinical research.\n",

            "This paper uses machine learning to refine a Land-use Regression (LUR) model and to estimate the spatial–temporal variation in BTEX concentrations in Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Using the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data of BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes) concentrations from 2015 to 2018, which includes local emission sources as a result of Asian cultural characteristics, a new LUR model is developed. The 2019 data was then used as external data to verify the reliability of the model. We used hybrid Kriging-land-use regression (Hybrid Kriging-LUR) models, geographically weighted regression (GWR), and two machine learning algorithms—random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)—for model development. Initially, the proposed Hybrid Kriging-LUR models explained each variation in BTEX from 37% to 52%. Using machine learning algorithms (XGBoost) increased the explanatory power of the models for each BTEX, between 61% and 79%. This study compared each combination of the Hybrid Kriging-LUR model and (i) GWR, (ii) RF, and (iii) XGBoost algorithm to estimate the spatiotemporal variation in BTEX concentration. It is shown that a combination of Hybrid Kriging-LUR and the XGBoost algorithm gives better performance than other integrated methods.\n",

Nowadays Social Networks are used for gaining influence in many fields like in elections, advertisements etc. It is not surprising that social media has become a weapon for manipulating sentiments by spreading disinformation. Propaganda is one of the systematic and deliberate attempts used for influencing people for the political, religious gains. In this research paper, efforts were made to classify Propagandist text from NonPropagandist text using supervised machine learning algorithms. Data was collected from the news sources from July 2018-August 2018. After annotating the text, feature engineering is performed using techniques like term frequency/inverse document frequency (TF/IDF) and Bag of words (BOW). The relevant features are supplied to support vector machine (SVM) and Multinomial Naïve Bayesian (MNB) classifiers. The fine tuning of SVM is being done by taking kernel Linear, Poly and RBF. SVM showed better results than MNB by having precision of 70%, recall of 76.5%, F1 Score of 69.5% and overall Accuracy of 69.2%.\n",

            "The graduates in every institution reflect the skills developed and competencies acquired by the tudents through the education offered by the institution that is suitable in the companies. Employability of graduates becomes one of the performance indicators for higher educational institutions (HEIs). Therefore, it is important to accentuate the employability of graduates. This is the reason why this research is being carried out. This study involved twenty-seven thousand (27,000) information consist of three thousand (3000) observations and twelve (12) features of student’s mock job interview evaluation results (MJI), on-the-job training (OJT) student’s performance rating and general point average (GPA) of students enrolled in the on-the-job training course of SY 2015 to SY 2018. To address the issue in imbalance datasets where the minority class, the researchers used synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) were applied in this study to address the issue in imbalanced datasets Six learning algorithms with SMOTE were used such as Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Support vector machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR) to understand how students, get employed. The six algorithms were evaluated through the performance matrix as accuracy measures, precision and recall measures, f1-score, and support measures. During the experiments, Support Vector Machine (SVM) obtained 91.22% inaccuracy measures which were significantly better than all of the learning algorithms, DT 85%, RF 84%. The learning curve produced during the experiment displays the training error results which were above the one for validation error while the validation curve displays the testing output where gamma was best at 10 to 100 in gamma 5. This concludes that the model produced with SVM was not under fitted and over-fit. This study is very promising which leads the researchers to be motivated to enhance the process and to validate the produced predictive model for further study.\n",

            "Hydro-climatic extremes can affect the reliability of electricity supply, in particular in countries that depend greatly on hydropower or cooling water and have a limited adaptive capacity. Assessments of the vulnerability of the power sector and of the impact of extreme events are thus crucial for decision-makers, and yet often they are severely constrained by data scarcity. Here, we introduce and validate an energy-climate-water framework linking remotely-sensed data from multiple satellite missions and instruments (TOPEX/POSEIDON. OSTM/Jason, VIIRS, MODIS, TMPA, AMSR-E) and field observations. The platform exploits random forests regression algorithms to mitigate data scarcity and predict river discharge variability when ungauged. The validated predictions are used to assess the impact of hydroclimatic extremes on hydropower reliability and on the final use of electricity in urban areas proxied by nighttime light radiance variation. We apply the framework to the case of Malawi for the periods 2000–2018 and 2012–2018 for hydrology and power, respectively. Our results highlight the significant impact of hydro-climatic variability and dry extremes on both the supply of electricity and its final use. We thus show that a modelling framework based on open-access data from satellites, machine learning algorithms, and regression analysis can mitigate data scarcity and improve the understanding of vulnerabilities. The proposed approach can support long-term infrastructure development monitoring and identify vulnerable populations, in particular under a changing climate.\n",

            "At CRYPTO 2018 Cramer et al. presented SPDZ2k , a new secret-sharing based protocol for actively secure multi-party computation against a dishonest majority, that works over rings instead of fields. Their protocol uses slightly more communication than competitive schemes working over fields. However, implementation-wise, their approach allows for arithmetic to be carried out using native 32 or 64-bit CPU operations rather than modulo a large prime. The authors thus conjectured that the increased communication would be more than made up for by the increased efficiency of implementations. In this work we answer their conjecture in the affirmative. We do so by implementing their scheme, and designing and implementing new efficient protocols for equality test, comparison, and truncation over rings. We further show that these operations find application in the machine learning domain, and indeed significantly outperform their field-based competitors. In particular, we implement and benchmark oblivious algorithms for decision tree and support vector machine (SVM) evaluation.\n",

This change fosters the development of data-driven science as a useful companion to the common model-driven data analysis paradigm, where astronomers develop automatic tools to mine datasets and extract novel information from them. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have become increasingly popular among astronomers, and are now used for a wide variety of tasks. In light of these developments, and the promise and challenges associated with them, the IAC Winter School 2018 focused on big data in Astronomy, with a particular emphasis on machine learning and deep learning techniques. This document summarizes the topics of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms presented during the school, and provides practical information on the application of such tools to astronomical datasets. In this document I cover basic topics in supervised machine learning, including selection and preprocessing of the input dataset, evaluation methods, and three popular supervised learning algorithms, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and shallow Artificial Neural Networks. My main focus is on unsupervised machine learning algorithms, that are used to perform cluster analysis, dimensionality reduction, visualization, and outlier detection. Unsupervised learning algorithms are of particular importance to scientific research, since they can be used to extract new knowledge from existing datasets, and can facilitate new discoveries.\n",

With the current information base, graduate students cannot make an informed decision on whether to start a doctorate or not (Benderly, 2018; Blank et al., 2017). However, administrative labor market data, which could provide the necessary information, are incomplete in this respect. In this paper, we describe the record linkage of two data sets to close this information gap: data on doctorate recipients collected in the catalog of the German National Library (DNB), and the German labor market biographies (IEB) from the German Institute of Employment Research. We use a machine learning-based methodology, which (a) improves the record linkage of data sets without unique identifiers, and (b) evaluates the quality of the record linkage. The machine learning algorithms are trained on a synthetic training and evaluation data set.

            "Abstract Only scarce information is available on doctorate recipients’ career outcomes (BuWiN, 2013). With the current information base, graduate students cannot make an informed decision on whether to start a doctorate or not (Benderly, 2018; Blank et al., 2017). However, administrative labor market data, which could provide the necessary information, are incomplete in this respect. In this paper, we describe the record linkage of two data sets to close this information gap: data on doctorate recipients collected in the catalog of the German National Library (DNB), and the German labor market biographies (IEB) from the German Institute of Employment Research. We use a machine learning-based methodology, which (a) improves the record linkage of data sets without unique identifiers, and (b) evaluates the quality of the record linkage. The machine learning algorithms are trained on a synthetic training and evaluation data set. In an exemplary analysis, we compare the evolution of the employment status of female and male doctorate recipients in Germany.\n",

Fraud detection is very important because service providers can feel a significant loss of income. We conducted a fraud research case study on one of the operators that experienced fraud in 2009 and 2018. Call Detail Record (CDR) containing records of customer conversations such as source and destination number, call start time, duration of calls at the operator can be a source of information to use in fraud detection. The method used in this study uses machine learning with unsupervised learning techniques which are quite popular methods used in fraud detection. The purpose of this study is to propose an effective method that can be applied to detect fraud on the CDR. Variables used include caller number, number dialled, duration, fee and destination city of the dataset totalling 11,418 rows from record periods 01 to 31 May 2018. In analyzing our CDR using the K-Means and DBSCAN algorithms, we then evaluate the results to calculate accuracy by comparing to actual fraud data. Based on evaluations using confusion matrix on actual CDR fraud, we obtained the K-Means algorithm to show a better accuracy value to model fraud on telecommunications CDR compared to DBSCAN.\n",

            "Monitoring and prediction of within-field crop variability can support farmers to make the right decisions in different situations. The current advances in remote sensing and the availability of high resolution, high frequency, and free Sentinel-2 images improve the implementation of Precision Agriculture (PA) for a wider range of farmers. This study investigated the possibility of using vegetation indices (VIs) derived from Sentinel-2 images and machine learning techniques to assess corn (Zea mays) grain yield spatial variability within the field scale. A 22-ha study field in North Italy was monitored between 2016 and 2018; corn yield was measured and recorded by a grain yield monitor mounted on the harvester machine recording more than 20,000 georeferenced yield observation points from the study field for each season. VIs from a total of 34 Sentinel-2 images at different crop ages were analyzed for correlation with the measured yield observations. Multiple regression and two different machine learning approaches were also tested to model corn grain yield. The three main results were the following: (i) the Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI) provided the highest R2 value of 0.48 for monitoring within-field variability of corn grain yield; (ii) the most suitable period for corn yield monitoring was a crop age between 105 and 135 days from the planting date (R4–R6); (iii) Random Forests was the most accurate machine learning approach for predicting within-field variability of corn yield, with an R2 value of almost 0.6 over an independent validation set of half of the total observations. Based on the results, within-field variability of corn yield for previous seasons could be investigated from archived Sentinel-2 data with GNDVI at crop stage (R4–R6).\n",

Specific DL-models were built based on raw data to categorize diagnostic group, disease complexity, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class. In addition, models were developed to estimate need for discussion at multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings and to gauge prognosis of individual patients. Overall, the DL-algorithms-based on over 44 000 medical records-categorized diagnosis, disease complexity, and NYHA class with an accuracy of 91.1%, 97.0%, and 90.6%, respectively in the test sample. Similarly, patient presentation at MDT-meetings was predicted with a test sample accuracy of 90.2%. During a median follow-up time of 8 years, 785 patients died.

            "Soil salinity caused by climate change associated with rising sea level is considered as one of the most severe natural hazards that has a negative effect on agricultural activities in the coastal areas in most tropical climates. This issue has become more severe and increasingly occurred in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam. The main objective of this work is to map soil salinity intrusion in Ben Tre province located on the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam using the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) C-band data combined with five state-of-the-art machine learning models, Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (MLP-NN), Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBF-NN), Gaussian Processes (GP), Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Random Forests (RF). For this purpose, 63 soil samples were collected during the field survey conducted from 4–6 April 2018 corresponding to the Sentinel-1 SAR imagery. The performance of the five models was assessed and compared using the root-mean-square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), and the correlation coefficient (r). The results revealed that the GP model yielded the highest prediction performance (RMSE = 2.885, MAE = 1.897, and r = 0.808) and outperformed the other machine learning models. We conclude that the advanced machine learning models can be used for mapping soil salinity in the Delta areas; thus, providing a useful tool for assisting farmers and the policy maker in choosing better crop types in the context of climate change.\n",

            "Background Although geriatric depression is prevalent, diagnosis using self-reporting instruments has limitations when measuring the depressed mood of older adults in a community setting. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) by using wearable devices could be used to collect data to classify older adults into depression groups. Objective The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning algorithm to predict the classification of depression groups among older adults living alone. We focused on utilizing diverse data collected through a survey, an Actiwatch, and an EMA report related to depression. Methods The prediction model using machine learning was developed in 4 steps: (1) data collection, (2) data processing and representation, (3) data modeling (feature engineering and selection), and (4) training and validation to test the prediction model. Older adults (N=47), living alone in community settings, completed an EMA to report depressed moods 4 times a day for 2 weeks between May 2017 and January 2018. Participants wore an Actiwatch that measured their activity and ambient light exposure every 30 seconds for 2 weeks. At baseline and the end of the 2-week observation, depressive symptoms were assessed using the Korean versions of the Short Geriatric Depression Scale (SGDS-K) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (K-HDRS). Conventional classification based on binary logistic regression was built and compared with 4 machine learning models (the logit, decision tree, boosted trees, and random forest models). Results On the basis of the SGDS-K and K-HDRS, 38% (18/47) of the participants were classified into the probable depression group. They reported significantly lower scores of normal mood and physical activity and higher levels of white and red, green, and blue (RGB) light exposures at different degrees of various 4-hour time frames (all P<.05). Sleep efficiency was chosen for modeling through feature selection. Comparing diverse combinations of the selected variables, daily mean EMA score, daily mean activity level, white and RGB light at 4:00 pm to 8:00 pm exposure, and daily sleep efficiency were selected for modeling. Conventional classification based on binary logistic regression had a good model fit (accuracy: 0.705; precision: 0.770; specificity: 0.859; and area under receiver operating characteristic curve or AUC: 0.754). Among the 4 machine learning models, the logit model had the best fit compared with the others (accuracy: 0.910; precision: 0.929; specificity: 0.940; and AUC: 0.960). Conclusions This study provides preliminary evidence for developing a machine learning program to predict the classification of depression groups in older adults living alone. Clinicians should consider using this method to identify underdiagnosed subgroups and monitor daily progression regarding treatment or therapeutic intervention in the community setting. Furthermore, more efforts are needed for researchers and clinicians to diversify data collection methods by using a survey, EMA, and a sensor.\n",

The comparison subcohort was a 5% random sample (n = 265 183) of living individuals in Denmark on January 1, 1995 (130 591 men [49.2%]; age, 37.4 [21.8] years and 134 592 women [50.8%]; age, 39.9 [23.4] years). With use of classification trees and random forests, sex-specific differences were noted in risk for suicide, with physical health more important to men's suicide risk than women's suicide risk. Psychiatric disorders and possibly associated medications were important to suicide risk, with specific results that may increase clarity in the literature. For example, stress disorders among unmarried men older than 30 years were important factors for suicide risk in the presence of depression (risk, 0.54). Generally, diagnoses and medications measured 48 months before suicide were more important indicators of suicide risk than when measured 6 months earlier. Individuals in the top 5% of predicted suicide risk appeared to account for 32.0% of all suicide cases in men and 53.4% of all cases in women.\n",

            "Purpose: To investigative the diagnostic performance of radiomics-based machine learning in differentiating glioblastomas (GBM) from metastatic brain tumors (MBTs). Method: The current study involved 134 patients diagnosed and treated in our institution between April 2014 and December 2018. Radiomics features were extracted from contrast-enhanced T1 weighted imaging (T1C). Thirty diagnostic models were built based on five selection methods and six classification algorithms. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under curve (AUC) of each model were calculated, and based on these the optimal model was chosen. Result : Two models represented promising diagnostic performance with AUC of 0.80. The first model was a combination of Distance Correlation as the selection method and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) as the classification algorithm. In the training group, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 0.75, 0.85, 0.80, and 0.80, respectively; and in the testing group, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC of the model were 0.69, 0.86, 0.78, and 0.80, respectively. The second model was the Distance Correlation as the selection method and logistic regression (LR) as the classification algorithm, with sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC of 0.75, 0.85, 0.80, 0.80 in the training group and 0.69, 0.86, 0.78, 0.80 in the testing group. Conclusion: Radiomic-based machine learning has potential to be utilized in differentiating GBM from MBTs.\n",

            "We present the construction of molecular force fields for small molecules (less than 25 atoms) using the recently developed symmetrized gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) approach [Chmiela et al., Nat. Commun. 9, 3887 (2018) and Chmiela et al., Sci. Adv. 3, e1603015 (2017)]. This approach is able to accurately reconstruct complex high-dimensional potential-energy surfaces from just a few 100s of molecular conformations extracted from ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. The data efficiency of the sGDML approach implies that atomic forces for these conformations can be computed with high-level wavefunction-based approaches, such as the \"gold standard\" coupled-cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. We demonstrate that the flexible nature of the sGDML model recovers local and non-local electronic interactions (e.g., H-bonding, proton transfer, lone pairs, changes in hybridization states, steric repulsion, and n → π* interactions) without imposing any restriction on the nature of interatomic potentials. The analysis of sGDML molecular dynamics trajectories yields new qualitative insights into dynamics and spectroscopy of small molecules close to spectroscopic accuracy.\n",

            "The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is one of the most developed regions in China. This is also a flood-prone area where flood disasters are frequently experienced; the situations between the people–land nexus and the people–water nexus are very complicated. Therefore, the accurate assessment of flood risk is of great significance to regional development. The paper took the YRD urban agglomeration as the research case. The driving force, pressure, state, impact and response (DPSIR) conceptual framework was established to analyze the indexes of flood disasters. The random forest (RF) algorithm was used to screen important indexes of floods risk, and a risk assessment model based on the radial basis function (RBF) neural network was constructed to evaluate the flood risk level in this region from 2009 to 2018. The risk map showed the I-V level of flood risk in the YRD urban agglomeration from 2016 to 2018 by using the geographic information system (GIS). Further analysis indicated that the indexes such as flood season rainfall, urban impervious area ratio, gross domestic product (GDP) per square kilometer of land, water area ratio, population density and emergency rescue capacity of public administration departments have important influence on flood risk. The flood risk has been increasing in the YRD urban agglomeration during the past ten years under the urbanization background, and economic development status showed a significant positive correlation with flood risks. In addition, there were serious differences in the rising rate of flood risks and the status quo among provinces. There are still a few cities that have stabilized at a better flood-risk level through urban flood control measures from 2016 to 2018. These results were basically in line with the actual situation, which validated the effectiveness of the model. Finally, countermeasures and suggestions for reducing the urban flood risk in the YRD region were proposed, in order to provide decision support for flood control, disaster reduction and emergency management in the YRD region.\n",

            "Background Diagnosis of schizophrenia (SCZ) is made exclusively clinically, since specific biomarkers that can predict the disease accurately remain unknown. Machine learning (ML) represents a promising approach that could support clinicians in the diagnosis of mental disorders. Objectives A systematic review, according to the PRISMA statement, was conducted to evaluate its accuracy to distinguish SCZ patients from healthy controls. Methods We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Library through December 2018 using generic terms for ML techniques and SCZ without language or time restriction. Thirty-five studies were included in this review: eight of them used structural neuroimaging, twenty-six used functional neuroimaging and one both, with a minimum accuracy >60% (most of them 75–90%). Sensitivity, Specificity and accuracy were extracted from each publication or obtained directly from authors. Results Support vector machine, the most frequent technique, if associated with other ML techniques achieved accuracy close to 100%. The prefrontal and temporal cortices appeared to be the most useful brain regions for the diagnosis of SCZ. ML analysis can efficiently detect significantly altered brain connectivity in patients with SCZ (eg, default mode network, visual network, sensorimotor network, frontoparietal network and salience network). Conclusion The greater accuracy demonstrated by these predictive models and the new models resulting from the integration of multiple ML techniques will be increasingly decisive for early diagnosis and evaluation of the treatment response and to establish the prognosis of patients with SCZ. To achieve a real benefit for patients, the future challenge is to reach an accurate diagnosis not only through clinical evaluation but also with the aid of ML algorithms.\n",

            "Background: The triage of patients in pre-hospital care is a difficult task, and improved risk assessment tools are needed both at the dispatch center and on the ambulance to differentiate between low- and high-risk patients. This study develops and validates a machine learning-based approach to predicting hospital outcomes based on routinely collected prehospital data. Methods: Dispatch, ambulance, and hospital data were collected in one Swedish region from 2016 to 2017. Dispatch center and ambulance records were used to develop gradient boosting models predicting hospital admission, critical care (defined as admission to an intensive care unit or in-hospital mortality), and two-day mortality. Model predictions were used to generate composite risk scores which were compared to National Early Warning System (NEWS) scores and actual dispatched priorities in a similar but prospectively gathered dataset from 2018. Results: A total of 38203 patients were included from 2016-2018. Concordance indexes (or area under the receiver operating characteristics curve) for dispatched priorities ranged from 0.51 to 0.66, while those for NEWS scores ranged from 0.66 to 0.85. Concordance ranged from 0.71 to 0.80 for risk scores based only on dispatch data, and 0.79 to 0.89 for risk scores including ambulance data. Dispatch data-based risk scores consistently outperformed dispatched priorities in predicting hospital outcomes, while models including ambulance data also consistently outperformed NEWS scores. Model performance in the prospective test dataset was similar to that found using cross-validation, and calibration was comparable to that of NEWS scores.\n",

            "Background Social media use is now ubiquitous, but the growth in social media communications has also made it a convenient digital platform for drug dealers selling controlled substances, opioids, and other illicit drugs. Previous studies and news investigations have reported the use of popular social media platforms as conduits for opioid sales. This study uses deep learning to detect illicit drug dealing on the image and video sharing platform Instagram. Objective The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a machine learning approach to detect Instagram posts related to illegal internet drug dealing. Methods In this paper, we describe an approach to detect drug dealers by using a deep learning model on Instagram. We collected Instagram posts using a Web scraper between July 2018 and October 2018 and then compared our deep learning model against 3 different machine learning models (eg, random forest, decision tree, and support vector machine) to assess the performance and accuracy of the model. For our deep learning model, we used the long short-term memory unit in the recurrent neural network to learn the pattern of the text of drug dealing posts. We also manually annotated all posts collected to evaluate our model performance and to characterize drug selling conversations. Results From the 12,857 posts we collected, we detected 1228 drug dealer posts comprising 267 unique users. We used cross-validation to evaluate the 4 models, with our deep learning model reaching 95% on F1 score and performing better than the other 3 models. We also found that by removing the hashtags in the text, the model had better performance. Detected posts contained hashtags related to several drugs, including the controlled substance Xanax (1078/1228, 87.78%), oxycodone/OxyContin (321/1228, 26.14%), and illicit drugs lysergic acid diethylamide (213/1228, 17.34%) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (94/1228, 7.65%). We also observed the use of communication applications for suspected drug trading through user comments. Conclusions Our approach using a combination of Web scraping and deep learning was able to detect illegal online drug sellers on Instagram, with high accuracy. Despite increased scrutiny by regulators and policymakers, the Instagram platform continues to host posts from drug dealers, in violation of federal law. Further action needs to be taken to ensure the safety of social media communities and help put an end to this illicit digital channel of sourcing.\n",

            "In recent decades, the fields of statistical and machine learning have seen a revolution in the development of data-adaptive regression methods that have optimal performance under flexible, sometimes minimal, assumptions on the true regression functions. These developments have impacted all areas of applied and theoretical statistics and have allowed data analysts to avoid the biases incurred under the pervasive practice of parametric model misspecification. In this commentary, I discuss issues around the use of data-adaptive regression in estimation of causal inference parameters. To ground ideas, I focus on two estimation approaches with roots in semi-parametric estimation theory: targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE; van der Laan and Rubin, 2006) and double/debiased machine learning (DML; Chernozhukov and others, 2018). This commentary is not comprehensive, the literature on these topics is rich, and there are many subtleties and developments which I do not address. These two frameworks represent only a small fraction of an increasingly large number of methods for causal inference using machine learning. To my knowledge, they are the only methods grounded in statistical semi-parametric theory that also allow unrestricted use of data-adaptive regression techniques.\n",

            "Objective: The purpose of the current study is to investigate whether texture analysis-based machine learning algorithms could help devise a non-invasive imaging biomarker for accurate classification of meningiomas using machine learning algorithms. Method: The study cohort was established from the hospital database by reviewing the medical records. Patients were selected if they underwent meningioma resection in the neurosurgery department between January 2015 and December 2018. A total number of 40 texture parameters were extracted from pretreatment postcontrast T1-weighted (T1C) images based on six matrixes. Three feature selection methods were adopted, namely, distance correlation, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT). Multiclass classification methods of linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms were employed to establish the classification models. The diagnostic performances of models were evaluated with confusion matrix based on which the areas under the curve, accuracy, and Kappa value of models were calculated. Result: Confusion matrix showed that the LDA-based models represented better diagnostic performances than SVM-based models. The highest accuracy among LDA-based models was 75.6%, shown in the combination of Lasso + LDA. The optimal models for SVM-based models was Lasso+SVM, with accuracy of 59.0% in the testing group. One of the SVM-based models, GBDT+SVM, was overfitting, suggesting that this model was not suitable for application. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithms with texture features extracted from T1C images could potentially serve as the assistant imaging biomarkers for presurgically grading meningiomas.\n",

            "Abstract In this paper, we study the double machine learning (DML) approach of Chernozhukov et al. (2018) for estimating average treatment effect and apply this approach to examine the Big N audit quality effect in the accounting literature. This approach relies on machine learning methods and is suitable when a high dimensional nuisance function with many covariates is present in the model. This approach does not suffer from the “regularization bias” when a learning method with a proper convergence rate is used. We demonstrate by simulations that, for the DML approach, the gradient boosting method is fairly robust and to be preferred to other methods, such as regression tree, random forest, support vector regression machine, and the conventional Nadaraya–Watson nonparametric estimator. We then apply the DML approach with gradient boosting to estimate the Big N effect. We find that Big N auditors have a positive effect on audit quality and that this effect is not only statistically significant but also economically important. We further show that, in contrast to the results of propensity score matching, our estimates of said effect are quite robust to the hyper-parameters in the gradient boosting algorithm.\n",

            "Machine Learning (ML) models trained on data from multiple demographic groups can inherit representation disparity (Hashimoto et al., 2018) that may exist in the data: the model may be less favorable to groups contributing less to the training process; this in turn can degrade population retention in these groups over time, and exacerbate representation disparity in the long run. In this study, we seek to understand the interplay between ML decisions and the underlying group representation, how they evolve in a sequential framework, and how the use of fairness criteria plays a role in this process. We show that the representation disparity can easily worsen over time under a natural user dynamics (arrival and departure) model when decisions are made based on a commonly used objective and fairness criteria, resulting in some groups diminishing entirely from the sample pool in the long run. It highlights the fact that fairness criteria have to be defined while taking into consideration the impact of decisions on user dynamics. Toward this end, we explain how a proper fairness criterion can be selected based on a general user dynamics model.\n",

            "Background Direct intraindividual comparison of dynamic CT myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) and machine learning (ML)-based CT fractional flow reserve (FFR) has not been explored for diagnosing hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease. Purpose To investigate the diagnostic performance of dynamic CT MPI and ML-based CT FFR for functional assessment of coronary stenosis. Materials and Methods Between January 2, 2017, and October 17, 2018, consecutive participants with stable angina were prospectively enrolled. All participants underwent dynamic CT MPI coronary CT angiography and invasive conventional coronary angiography (CCA) FFR within 2 weeks. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess diagnostic performance. Results Eighty-six participants (mean age, 67 years ± 12 [standard deviation]; 67 men) with 157 target vessels were included for final analysis. The mean radiation doses for dynamic CT MPI and coronary CT angiography were 3.6 mSv ± 1.1 and 2.7 mSv ± 0.8, respectively. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was lower in ischemic segments compared with nonischemic segments and reference segments (defined as the territory of vessels without stenosis) (75 mL/100 mL/min ± 20 vs 148 mL/100 mL/min ± 22 and 169 mL/100 mL/min ± 34, respectively, both P < .001). Similarly, CT FFR was also lower for hemodynamically significant lesions than for hemodynamically nonsignificant lesions (0.68 ± 0.1 vs 0.83 ± 0.1, respectively, P < .001). MBF had the largest area under the ROC curve (AUC) (using 99 mL/100 mL/min as a cutoff) among all parameters, outperforming ML-based CT FFR (AUC = 0.97 vs 0.85, P < .001). The vessel-based specificity and diagnostic accuracy of MBF were higher than those of ML-based CT FFR (93% vs 68%, P < .001 and 94% vs 78%, respectively, P = .04) whereas the sensitivity of both methods was similar (96% vs 88%, respectively, P = .11). Conclusion Dynamic CT myocardial perfusion imaging was able to help accurately evaluate the hemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis using a reduced amount of radiation. In addition, the myocardial blood flow derived from dynamic CT myocardial perfusion imaging outperformed machine learning-based CT fractional flow reserve for identifying lesions causing ischemia. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.\n",

            "Background In the recent years, machine learning algorithms have been more widely and increasingly applied in biomedical fields. In particular, their application has been drawing more attention in the field of psychiatry, for instance, as diagnostic tests/tools for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, given their complexity and potential clinical implications, there is an ongoing need for further research on their accuracy. Objective This study aimed to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to summarize the available evidence for the accuracy of machine learning algorithms in diagnosing ASD. Methods The following databases were searched on November 28, 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL Complete (with Open Dissertations), PsycINFO, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Xplore Digital Library. Studies that used a machine learning algorithm partially or fully for distinguishing individuals with ASD from control subjects and provided accuracy measures were included in our analysis. The bivariate random effects model was applied to the pooled data in a meta-analysis. A subgroup analysis was used to investigate and resolve the source of heterogeneity between studies. True-positive, false-positive, false-negative, and true-negative values from individual studies were used to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity values, draw Summary Receiver Operating Characteristics curves, and obtain the area under the curve (AUC) and partial AUC (pAUC). Results A total of 43 studies were included for the final analysis, of which a meta-analysis was performed on 40 studies (53 samples with 12,128 participants). A structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) subgroup meta-analysis (12 samples with 1776 participants) showed a sensitivity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.76-0.89), a specificity of 0.84 (95% CI 0.74-0.91), and AUC/pAUC of 0.90/0.83. A functional magnetic resonance imaging/deep neural network subgroup meta-analysis (5 samples with 1345 participants) showed a sensitivity of 0.69 (95% CI 0.62-0.75), specificity of 0.66 (95% CI 0.61-0.70), and AUC/pAUC of 0.71/0.67. Conclusions The accuracy of machine learning algorithms for diagnosis of ASD was considered acceptable by few accuracy measures only in cases of sMRI use; however, given the many limitations indicated in our study, further well-designed studies are warranted to extend the potential use of machine learning algorithms to clinical settings.

In this paper, we investigate data-driven predictive models for natural gas price forecasting based on common machine learning tools, i.e., artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), gradient boosting machines (GBM), and Gaussian process regression (GPR).

            "Abstract. Iodide in the sea-surface plays an important role in the Earth system. It modulates the oxidising capacity of the troposphere and provides iodine to terrestrial ecosystems. However, our understanding of its distribution is limited due to a paucity of observations. Previous efforts to generate global distributions have generally fitted sea-surface iodide observations to relatively simple functions using proxies for iodide such as nitrate and sea-surface temperature. This approach fails to account for coastal influences and variation in the bio-geochemical environment. Here we use a machine learning regression approach (random forest regression) to generate a high-resolution (0.125∘×0.125∘, ∼12.5km×12.5km), monthly dataset of present-day global sea-surface iodide. We use a compilation of iodide observations (1967–2018) that has a 45 % larger sample size than has been used previously as the dependent variable and co-located ancillary parameters (temperature, nitrate, phosphate, salinity, shortwave radiation, topographic depth, mixed layer depth, and chlorophyll a) from global climatologies as the independent variables. We investigate the regression models generated using different combinations of ancillary parameters and select the 10 best-performing models to be included in an ensemble prediction. We then use this ensemble of models, combined with global fields of the ancillary parameters, to predict new high-resolution monthly global sea-surface iodide fields representing the present day. Sea-surface temperature is the most important variable in all 10 models. We estimate a global average sea-surface iodide concentration of 106 nM (with an uncertainty of ∼20 %), which is within the range of previous estimates (60–130 nM). Similar to previous work, higher concentrations are predicted for the tropics than for the extra-tropics. Unlike the previous parameterisations, higher concentrations are also predicted for shallow areas such as coastal regions and the South China Sea. Compared to previous work, the new parameterisation better captures observed variability. The iodide concentrations calculated here are significantly higher (40 % on a global basis) than the commonly used MacDonald et al. (2014) parameterisation, with implications for our understanding of iodine in the atmosphere. We envisage these fields could be used to represent present-day sea-surface iodide concentrations, in applications such as climate and air-quality modelling. The global iodide dataset is made freely available to the community (https://doi.org/10/gfv5v3, Sherwen et al., 2019), and as new observations are made, we will update the global dataset through a “living data” model.\n",

            "A deep learning network, long short-term memory (LSTM), is used to predict whether an active region (AR) will produce a flare of class Γ in the next 24 hr. We consider Γ to be ≥M (strong flare), ≥C (medium flare), and ≥A (any flare) class. The essence of using LSTM, which is a recurrent neural network, is its ability to capture temporal information on the data samples. The input features are time sequences of 20 magnetic parameters from the space weather Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager AR patches. We analyze ARs from 2010 June to 2018 December and their associated flares identified in the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite X-ray flare catalogs. Our results produce skill scores consistent with recently published results using LSTMs and are better than the previous results using a single time input. The skill scores from the model show statistically significant variation when different years of data are chosen for training and testing. In particular, 2015–2018 have better true skill statistic and Heidke skill scores for predicting ≥C medium flares than 2011–2014, when the difference in flare occurrence rates is properly taken into account.\n",

            "Background and Aims: Accurately predicting the response to methotrexate (MTX) in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients before administration is the key point to improve the treatment outcome. However, no simple and reliable prediction model has been identified. Here, we aimed to develop and validate predictive models for the MTX response to JIA using machine learning based on electronic medical record (EMR) before and after administering MTX. Materials and Methods: Data of 362 JIA patients with MTX mono-therapy were retrospectively collected from EMR between January 2008 and October 2018. DAS44/ESR-3 simplified standard was used to evaluate the MTX response. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and logistic regression (LR) algorithms were applied to develop and validate models with 5-fold cross-validation on the randomly split training and test set. Data of 13 patients additionally collected were used for external validation. Results: The XGBoost screened out the optimal 10 pre-administration features and 6 mix-variables. The XGBoost established the best model based on the 10 pre-administration variables. The performances were accuracy 91.78%, sensitivity 90.70%, specificity 93.33%, AUC 97.00%, respectively. Similarly, the XGBoost developed a better model based on the 6 mix-variables, whose performances were accuracy 94.52%, sensitivity 95.35%, specificity 93.33%, AUC 99.00%, respectively. Conclusion: Based on common EMR data, we developed two MTX response predictive models with excellent performance in JIA using machine learning. These models can predict the MTX efficacy early and accurately, which provides powerful decision support for doctors to make or adjust therapeutic scheme before or after treatment.\n",

In this study we leverage machine learning techniques using 6 years of continuous seismic data from the Piton de la Fournaise volcano (La Réunion island) to describe specific patterns of seismic signals recorded during eruptions. These results unveil what we interpret as signals associated with various eruptive dynamics of the volcano, including the effusion of a large volume of lava during the August–October 2015 eruption as well as the closing of the eruptive vent during the September–November 2018 eruption. The machine learning workflow we describe can easily be applied to other active volcanoes, potentially leading to an enhanced understanding of the temporal and spatial evolution of volcanic eruptions.\n",

            "In recent times, football (soccer) has aroused an increasing amount of attention across continents and entered unexpected dimensions. In this course, the number of bookmakers, who offer the opportunity to bet on the outcome of football games, expanded enormously, which was further strengthened by the development of the world wide web. In this context, one could generate positive returns over time by betting based on a strategy which successfully identifies overvalued betting odds. Due to the large number of matches around the globe, football matches in particular have great potential for such a betting strategy. This paper utilizes machine learning to forecast the outcome of football games based on match and player attributes. A simulation study which includes all matches of the five greatest European football leagues and the corresponding second leagues between 2006 and 2018 revealed that an ensemble strategy achieves statistically and economically significant returns of 1.58% per match. Furthermore, the combination of different machine learning algorithms could neither be outperformed by the individual machine learning approaches nor by a linear regression model or naive betting strategies, such as always betting on the victory of the home team.\n",

            "Objectives The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has increased significantly in recent years. With the development of artificial intelligence applications in healthcare, they are used for diagnosis, therapeutic decision making, and outcome prediction, especially in type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study aimed to identify the artificial intelligence (AI) applications for type 2 diabetes mellitus care. Methods This is a review conducted in 2018. We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase scientific databases, based on a combination of related mesh terms. The article selection process was based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Finally, 31 articles were selected after inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Data gathering was done by using a data extraction form. Data were summarized and reported based on the study objectives. Results The main applications of AI for type 2 diabetes mellitus care were screening and diagnosis in different stages. Among all of the reviewed AI methods, machine learning methods with 71% (n = 22) were the most commonly applied techniques. Many applications were in multi method forms (23%). Among the machine learning algorithms applications, support vector machine (21%) and naive Bayesian (19%) were the most commonly used methods. The most important variables that were used in the selected studies were body mass index, fasting blood sugar, blood pressure, HbA1c, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and demographic variables. Conclusions It is recommended to select optimal algorithms by testing various techniques. Support vector machine and naive Bayesian might achieve better performance than other applications due to the type of variables and targets in diabetes-related outcomes classification.\n",

            "Solar power systems and their related technologies have developed into a globally utilized green energy source. Given the relatively high installation costs, low conversion rates and battery capacity issues, solar energy is still not a widely applied energy source when compared to traditional energy sources. Despite the challenges, there are many innovative studies of new materials and new methods for improving solar energy transformation efficiency to improve the competitiveness of solar energy in the marketplace. This research searches for promising solar power technologies by text mining 2280 global patents and 5610 literature papers of the past decade (January 2008 to June 2018). First, a solar power knowledge ontology schema (or a key term relationship map) is constructed from the comprehensive literature and patent review. Non-supervised machine learning techniques for clustering patents and literature combined with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling algorithm identify sub-technology clusters and their main topics. A word-embedding algorithm is applied to identify the patent documents of the specified technologies. Cross-validation of the results is used to model the technology progress with a patent evolution map. Initial analysis show that many patents focus on solar hydropower storage systems, transferring light generated power to waterpower gravity systems. Batteries are also used but have several limitations. The objectives of this research are to review solar technology development progress and describe the innovation path that has evolved for the solar power domain. By adopting unsupervised learning approaches for literature and patent mining, this research develops a novel technology e-discovery methodology and presents the detailed reviews and analyses of the solar power technology using the proposed e-discovery workflow. The insights of global solar technology development, based on both comprehensive literature and patent reviews and cross-analyses, helps energy companies select advanced technologies related to their key technical R&D strengths and business interests. The structured solar-related technology mining can be extended to the analysis of other forms of renewable energy development.\n",

            "The latest generation of synthetic aperture radar satellites produce measurements of ground deformation at the majority of the world's subaerial active volcanoes and can be used to detect signs of volcanic unrest. We present an automatic detection algorithm that uses these data to automatically warn when deformation at a volcano departs from the background. We demonstrate our approach on synthetic data sets and the unrest leading to the 2018 eruption of Sierra Negra (Galapagos). Our algorithm encompasses spatial independent component analysis and uses a significantly improved version of the ICASO algorithm, which we term ICASAR, to robustly perform spatial independent component analysis. We use ICASAR to isolate signals of geophysical interest from atmospheric signals, before monitoring the evolution of these signals through time in order to detect the onset of a period of volcanic unrest.\n",

            "(1) Background: Cough is a major presentation in childhood asthma. Here, we aim to develop a machine-learning based cough sound classifier for asthmatic and healthy children. (2) Methods: Children less than 16 years old were randomly recruited in a Children’s Hospital, from February 2017 to April 2018, and were divided into 2 cohorts—healthy children and children with acute asthma presenting with cough. Children with other concurrent respiratory conditions were excluded in the asthmatic cohort. Demographic data, duration of cough, and history of respiratory status were obtained. Children were instructed to produce voluntary cough sounds. These clinically labeled cough sounds were randomly divided into training and testing sets. Audio features such as Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients and Constant-Q Cepstral Coefficients were extracted. Using a training set, a classification model was developed with Gaussian Mixture Model–Universal Background Model (GMM-UBM). Its predictive performance was tested using the test set against the physicians’ labels. (3) Results: Asthmatic cough sounds from 89 children (totaling 1192 cough sounds) and healthy coughs from 89 children (totaling 1140 cough sounds) were analyzed. The sensitivity and specificity of the audio-based classification model was 82.81% and 84.76%, respectively, when differentiating coughs from asthmatic children versus coughs from ‘healthy’ children. (4) Conclusion: Audio-based classification using machine learning is a potentially useful technique in assisting the differentiation of asthmatic cough sounds from healthy voluntary cough sounds in children.\n",

Theory Comput. 2018, 14, 5739], where an artificial neural network (ANN) learns on the fly to select important configurations, is further developed so that accurate ab initio potential energy curves can be efficiently calculated. This development includes employing the artificial neural network also as a hash function for the efficient deletion of duplicates on the fly so that the singles and doubles space does not need to be stored and this barrier to scalability is removed. In addition configuration state functions are introduced into the approach so that pure spin states are guaranteed, and the transferability of data between geometries is exploited. This improved approach is demonstrated on potential energy curves for the nitrogen molecule, water, and carbon monoxide. The results are compared with full configuration interaction values, when available, and different transfer protocols are investigated. It is shown that, for all of the considered systems, accurate potential energy curves can now be efficiently computed with MLCI. For the potential curves of N2 and CO, MLCI can achieve lower errors than stochastically selecting configurations while also using substantially less processor hours.\n",

            "Background: Breast Cancer (BC) is a known global crisis. The World Health Organization reports a global 2.09 million incidences and 627,000 deaths in 2018 relating to BC. The traditional BC screening method in developed countries is mammography, whilst developing countries employ breast self-examination and clinical breast examination. The prominent gold standard for BC detection is triple assessment: i) clinical examination, ii) mammography and/or ultrasonography; and iii) Fine Needle Aspirate Cytology. However, the introduction of cheaper, efficient and noninvasive methods of BC screening and detection would be beneficial. Design and methods: We propose the use of eight machine learning algorithms: i) Logistic Regression; ii) Support Vector Machine; iii) K-Nearest Neighbors; iv) Decision Tree; v) Random Forest; vi) Adaptive Boosting; vii) Gradient Boosting; viii) eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and blood test results using BC Coimbra Dataset (BCCD) from University of California Irvine online database to create models for BC prediction. To ensure the models’ robustness, we will employ: i) Stratified k-fold Cross- Validation; ii) Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS); and iii) parameter tuning. The models will be validated on validation and test sets of BCCD for full features and reduced features. Feature reduction has an impact on algorithm performance. Seven metrics will be used for model evaluation, including accuracy. Expected impact of the study for public health: The CFS together with highest performing model(s) can serve to identify important specific blood tests that point towards BC, which may serve as an important BC biomarker. Highest performing model(s) may eventually be used to create an Artificial Intelligence tool to assist clinicians in BC screening and detection. Significance for public health This study could potentially identify important Breast Cancer (BC) biomarkers based on patients’ routine anthropometric blood data. This will be attempted using correlation-based feature selection algorithm, together with highest performing machine learning model(s) from this study, and publicly available BC Coimbra Dataset from University of California Irvine database. The biomarkers may provide direction for clinicians to explore in future BC clinical trials. Trials will serve to validate biomarkers from this study and could be introduced in clinical settings globally as an easy, cost-effective first step for BC screening and detection. An Artificial Intelligence tool can eventually be created using highest performing model(s). Clinicians can input patient-specific biomarkers into the tool. The tool would output the likelihood of patients having BC, with a certain level of accuracy. This envisioned process could serve to eventually revolutionize the early prediction of BC in patients and consequently, a reduction in BC mortality rate.\n",

Monthly price data for the period January 2000 to December 2018 was used for the study. The data was further split into two periods, period I from January 2000 to October 2011 during which the gold price exhibits a raising trend and period II from November 2011 to December 2018 where the gold price is showing a horizontal trend. Three machine learning algorithms, linear regression, random forest regression and gradient boosting regression were used in analyzing these data. It is found that the correlation between the variables is strong during the period I and weak during period II. While these models show good fit with data during period I, the fitness is not good during the period II. While random forest regression is found to have better prediction accuracy for the entire period, gradient boosting regression is found to give better accuracy for the two periods taken separately.\n",

            "Machine learning, especially the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) model, has been developed tremendously in recent years. Since the NVIDIA Machine Learning group presented the StyleGAN in December 2018, it has become a new way for designers to make machines learn different or similar types of architectural photos, drawings, and renderings, then generate (a) similar fake images, (b) style-mixing images, and (c) truncation trick images. The author both collected and created input image data, and specially made architectural plan and section drawing inputs with a clear design purpose, then applied StyleGAN to train specific networks on these datasets. With the training process, we could look into the deep relationship between these input architectural plans or sections, then generate serialized transformation images (truncation trick images) to form the 3D (three-dimensional) model with a decent resolution (up to 1024 × 1024 × 1024 pixels). Though the results of the 3D model generation are difficult to use directly in 3D spatial modeling, these unexpected 3D forms still could inspire new design methods and greater possibilities of architectural plan and section design.\n",

            "Purpose: The aim of this study was to test whether radiomics-based machine learning can enable the better differentiation between glioblastoma (GBM) and anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO). Methods: This retrospective study involved 126 patients histologically diagnosed as GBM (n = 76) or AO (n = 50) in our institution from January 2015 to December 2018. A total number of 40 three-dimensional texture features were extracted from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images using LIFEx package. Six diagnostic models were established with selection methods and classifiers. The optimal radiomics features were separately selected into three datasets with three feature selection methods [distance correlation, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT)]. Then datasets were separately adopted into linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. Specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, and area under curve (AUC) of each model were calculated to evaluate their diagnostic performances. Results: The diagnostic performance of machine learning models was superior to human readers. Both classifiers showed promising ability in discrimination with AUC more than 0.900 when combined with suitable feature selection method. For LDA-based models, the AUC of models were 0.986, 0.994, and 0.970 in the testing group, respectively. For the SVM-based models, the AUC of models were 0.923, 0.817, and 0.500 in the testing group, respectively. The over-fitting model was GBDT + SVM, suggesting that this model was too volatile that unsuitable for classification. Conclusion: This study indicates radiomics-based machine learning has the potential to be utilized in clinically discriminating GBM from AO.\n",

            "In this paper we propose an efficient method to compute the price of multi-asset American options, based on Machine Learning, Monte Carlo simulations and variance reduction technique. Specifically, the options we consider are written on a basket of assets, each of them following a Black-Scholes dynamics. In the wake of Ludkovski's approach (2018), we implement here a backward dynamic programming algorithm which considers a finite number of uniformly distributed exercise dates. On these dates, the option value is computed as the maximum between the exercise value and the continuation value, which is obtained by means of Gaussian process regression technique and Monte Carlo simulations. Such a method performs well for low dimension baskets but it is not accurate for very high dimension baskets. In order to improve the dimension range, we employ the European option price as a control variate, which allows us to treat very large baskets and moreover to reduce the variance of price estimators. Numerical tests show that the proposed algorithm is fast and reliable, and it can handle also American options on very large baskets of assets, overcoming the problem of the curse of dimensionality.\n",

            "Small earthquakes following a large event in the same area are typically aftershocks, which are usually less destructive than mainshocks. These aftershocks are considered mainshocks if they are larger than the previous mainshock. In this study, records of aftershocks (M > 2.5) of the Kermanshah Earthquake (M 7.3) in Iran were collected from the first second following the event to the end of September 2018. Different machine learning (ML) algorithms, including naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, a support vector machine, and random forests were used in conjunction with the slip distribution, Coulomb stress change on the source fault (deduced from synthetic aperture radar imagery), and orientations of neighboring active faults to predict the aftershock patterns. Seventy percent of the aftershocks were used for training based on a binary (“yes” or “no”) logic to predict locations of all aftershocks. While untested on independent datasets, receiver operating characteristic results of the same dataset indicate ML methods outperform routine Coulomb maps regarding the spatial prediction of aftershock patterns, especially when details of neighboring active faults are available. Logistic regression results, however, do not show significant differences with ML methods, as hidden information is likely better discovered using logistic regression analysis.\n",

Monthly mean sunspot number data during the 1856-June 2018 (solar cycles 10-24) from the World Data Center SILSO, Royal Observatory of Belgium, Brussels are used as machine learning inputs. According to LR, RF, RBF and SVM, the maximum of Solar Cycle 25 is predicted to occur in September 2023 (sunspot number of 159.4 ± 22.3), in December 2024 (sunspot number of 110.2 ± 12.8), in December 2024 (sunspot number of 95.5 ± 21.9) and in July 2024 (sunspot number of 93.7 ± 23.2), respectively. The prediction using LR method suggested that Solar Cycle 25 maximum will be slightly higher than the current cycle, while RBF and SVM suggested much lower cycles. RF prediction suggested a lower maximum with well-constructed double-peak. It was also found that the Solar Cycle 25 is predicted to begin in the late 2019 or early 2020 according to all four methods.\n",

            "Applying machine learning methods and analysis on remotely sensed color, multispectral, and thermal imagery has been recognized as a potentially cost-effective approach for detecting the location of various weed species in-field. This detection approach has the potential to be an important first step for broader Site-Specific Weed Management procedures (SSWM). The objective of this research was to create a method for automating the detection of weeds in corn and soybean fields, at different stages of the growing season. Sensors based on an unmanned aerial vehicle were used to capture imagery used for this research. We focused on identifying four common weed types present in Midwestern fields. This research involved: 1) collecting color, multispectral, and thermal imagery from UAV based sensors in corn and soybean fields throughout the 2018 growing season, 2) creating individual normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) images from the near-infrared (NIR) and red multispectral bands 3) applying image thresholding and smoothing techniques on the NDVI imagery , 4) manually drawing bounding boxes and hand labelling vegetation blobs from the processed imagery using color images as the ground truth, 5) developing a training set of these processed, labeled images that represent weeds at different crop growth stages. Preliminary results of these methods show promise in creating an affordable first step to target herbicide application.\n",

            "This study aims to apply an approach using machine learning for predicting students' employability. The researchers conducted a case study that involved 27,000 information (3000 observations and 9 features) of students' Mock Job Interview Evaluation Results, On-the Job Training (OJT) Student Performance Rating and General Point Average (GPA) of students enrolled in OJT course of School Year 2015 to School Year 2018. Three learning algorithms were used such as Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), and Support vector machine (SVM) in order to understand how students get employed. The three algorithms were evaluated through the performance matrix as accuracy measures, precision and recall measures, f1-score and support measures. During the experiments Support Vector machine (SVM) obtained 91.22% in accuracy measures which was significantly better than all of the learning algorithms, DT 85%, RF 84%. The learning curve produced during the experiment displays the training error results which were above the one for validation error while the validation curve displays the testing output where gamma was best at 10 to 100 in gamma 5. This concludes that the model produced with SVM was not underfit and over-fit. This study is very promising that lead to the researchers to be motivated to enhanced the process and to validate the produced predictive model for further study.\n",

There has been a surge in the crime rate over the past couple of years. To reduce the offense rate, law enforcement needs to embrace innovative preventive technological measures. Accurate crime forecasts help to decrease the crime rate. However, predicting criminal activities is difficult due to the high complexity associated with modeling numerous intricate elements. In this work, we employ statistical analysis methods and machine learning models for predicting different types of crimes in New York City, based on 2018 crime datasets. We combine weather, and its temporal attributes like cloud cover, lighting and time of day to identify relevance to crime data. We note that weatherrelated attributes play a negligible role in crime forecasting. We have evaluated the various performance metrics of crime prediction, with and without the consideration of weather datasets, on different types of crime committed. Our proposed methodology will enable law enforcement to make effective decisions on appropriate resource allocation, including backup officers related to crime type and location.\n",

            "Machine learning classifiers have been rarely used for the identification of seafloor sediment types in the rapidly changing dredge pits for coastal restoration. Our study uses multiple machine learning classifiers to identify the sediment types of the Caminada dredge pit in the eastern part of the submarine sandy Ship Shoal of the Louisiana inner shelf of the United States (USA), and compares the performance of multiple supervised classification methods. High-resolution bathymetry and backscatter data, as well as 58 sediment grab samples were collected in the Caminada pit in August 2018, about two years after dredging. Two primary features (bathymetry and backscatter) and four secondary features were selected in the machine learning models. Three supervised classifications were tested in the study area: Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Regularized Logistic Regression. The models were trained using three different combinations of features: (1) all six features, (2) only bathymetry and backscatter features, and (3) a subset of selected features. The best performing model was the Random Forest method, but its performance was relatively poor when dealing with a few mixed (sand and mud) surficial sediment samples. The model provides a new and efficient method to predict the change of sediment distribution inside the Caminada pit over time, and is more reliable when predicting mixed bed with rough pit bottoms. Our results can be used to better understand the impacts on biological communities by (1) direct defaunation after initial sand excavation, (2) later mud accumulation in topographic lows, and (3) other geological and physical processes. In the future, the deposition and redistribution of mud inside the Caminada pit will continue, likely impacting benthos and water quality. Backscatter, roughness derived from bathymetry, rugosity derived from backscatter, and bathymetry (in the importance order from high to low) were identified as the most effective predictors of sediment texture for mineral resources management.\n",

            "Abstract The spatial resolution of Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image, a pixel size of 500 m at azimuth/flight direction for Global Observation (GLO) and 100 m for Wide ScanSAR (WSC) modes, is relatively coarse, and waves shorter than 100 m are undetectable. In this study, SAR images collected under typhoon conditions by the GF-3 mission are exploited for wave retrieval purposes. In detail, six imagery collected during 2017 and 2018 over the China Seas captured four typhoons. The GLO and WSC modes images are collocated with simulated wave fields using a numeric wave model, called WAVEWATCH-III (WW3) and are processed using a machine learning method to retrieve sea surface waves. In this work, the criterion for the training completion in the process of machine learning is set as 0.15 m of Root mean Square Error (RMSE) for the Significant Wave Height (SWH). Then, the retrieved SWH is compared with measurements collected by the Jason-2 altimeter, showing a 0.61 m RMSE. The proposed algorithm is shown to outperform empirical approaches developed to retrieve the SWH using GF-3 SAR imagery acquired in the GLO and WSC imaging modes.\n",

            "Background Timely data is key to effective public health responses to epidemics. Drug overdose deaths are identified in surveillance systems through ICD-10 codes present on death certificates. ICD-10 coding takes time, but free-text information is available on death certificates prior to ICD-10 coding. The objective of this study was to develop a machine learning method to classify free-text death certificates as drug overdoses to provide faster drug overdose mortality surveillance. Methods Using 2017–2018 Kentucky death certificate data, free-text fields were tokenized and features were created from these tokens using natural language processing (NLP). Word, bigram, and trigram features were created as well as features indicating the part-of-speech of each word. These features were then used to train machine learning classifiers on 2017 data. The resulting models were tested on 2018 Kentucky data and compared to a simple rule-based classification approach. Documented code for this method is available for reuse and extensions: https://github.com/pjward5656/dcnlp. Results The top scoring machine learning model achieved 0.96 positive predictive value (PPV) and 0.98 sensitivity for an F-score of 0.97 in identification of fatal drug overdoses on test data. This machine learning model achieved significantly higher performance for sensitivity (p<0.001) than the rule-based approach. Additional feature engineering may improve the model’s prediction. This model can be deployed on death certificates as soon as the free-text is available, eliminating the time needed to code the death certificates. Conclusion Machine learning using natural language processing is a relatively new approach in the context of surveillance of health conditions. This method presents an accessible application of machine learning that improves the timeliness of drug overdose mortality surveillance. As such, it can be employed to inform public health responses to the drug overdose epidemic in near-real time as opposed to several weeks following events.\n",

            "The number of Malicious Websites has increased manifold in the past few years. As on start of year 2018, 1 in every 13 URL was malicious, amounting to 7.8% URLs identified as malicious [1]. These figures have increased by 2.8%, thereby showing an increasing trend of attack vectors through Malicious Websites. These statistics clearly highlight the need to detect Malicious Websites on the Internet. Many research works have suggested Machine Learning techniques to detect Malicious Websites. Research has also been done to compare Machine Learning algorithms for their detection. However, the aspect of attribute selection for detecting Malicious Websites using Machine Learning has not been delved in detail. In Machine Learning techniques, attribute selection outweighs the importance of any other aspect in the process. Thus, there is a need to compare and analyze the various attributes that can help find Malicious Websites faster and better. This paper is focused to address this research gap, so that, fewer and optimal attributes can do a better job.\n",

This study proposes the use of the PHP programming language (technological knowledge), the topics of Normal Distribution (content knowledge) and computer simulation (pedagogical knowledge) to create the Web Application on the Educational Process of Statistics (WAEPS). The sample consists of 61 students who took the subject Statistical Instrumentation for Business during the 2018 school year. The results of the linear regression (machine learning with 50% and 70% of training) indicate that the WAEPS facilitates the educational process on statistics. In fact, the WAEPS promotes the active role in the student, develops mathematical skills and facilitates the assimilation of knowledge about the calculation of upper and lower limits in the Normal Distribution by means of data simulation, interactivity and navigation. Even students consider that this web application is innovative and useful for the educational field. In addition, data science (decision tree technique) identifies various predictive models on the impact of the WAEPS in the educational process. Finally, the TPACK model is an ideal frame of reference to innovate the teaching–learning process through technological, pedagogical and content knowledge.\n",

            "The objective of this work is to present a machine learning (ML) -based framework to identify evidence about collaborative problem solving (CPS) cognitive (teamwork) and social-emotional learning (SEL) skills from the dyadic (human-human-HH) interactions. This work extends our previous work (Chopade et al. IEEE HST 2018, LAK2019) [1], [2]. Explicitly, we are interested in how teamwork skills and team dynamics are demonstrated as verbal and nonverbal behaviors, and how these behaviors can be captured and analyzed via passive data collection. For this work we use a two-player cooperative CPS game, Crisis in Space (CIS) from LRNG (Previously GlassLab Inc). During the summer of 2018, we implemented this CIS game for interns as a group study. A total of 34 participants played the game and provided study and survey data. During the study, we collected participants' game play data, such as audio, video and eye tracking data streams. This research involves analyzing CIS multimodal game data, and developing skill models, and machine learning techniques for CPS skills measurement. In this paper, we present our ML framework for the analysis of audio data along with preliminary results from a pilot study. The analysis of audio data uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as bag-of-words and sentence embedding. Our preliminary results show that various NLP features can be used to describe successful and unsuccessful CPS performances. The ML based framework supports the development of evidence centered design for teamwork skills-mapping and aims to help teams operate effectively in a complex situation. Potential applications of this work include support for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the US Army for the development of learner and team centric training, cohort, and team behavioral skill-mapping.\n",

            "Interactive machine learning (IML) is a learning process in which a user interacts with a system to iteratively define and optimise a model. Although recent years have illustrated the proliferation of IML systems in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Information Systems (IS), and Computer Science (CS), current research results are scattered leading to a lack of integration of existing work on IML. Furthermore, due to diverging functionalities and purposes IML systems can refer to, an uncertainty exists regarding the underlying distinct capabilities that constitute this class of systems. By reviewing extensive IML literature, this paper suggests an integrative theoretical framework for IML systems to address these current impediments. Reviewing 2,879 studies in leading journals and conferences during the years 1966-2018, we found an extensive range of applications areas that have implemented IML systems and the necessity to standardise the evaluation of those systems. Our framework offers an essential step to provide a theoretical foundation to integrate concepts and findings across different fields of research. The main contribution of this paper is organising and structuring the body of knowledge in IML for the advancement of the field. Furthermore, we suggest three opportunities for future IML research. From a practical point of view, our integrative theoretical framework can serve as a reference guide to inform the design and implementation of IML systems.\n",

The collimators are positioned close to the beam in the form of a hierarchy, which is guaranteed by precisely aligning each collimator with a precision of a few tens of micrometers. During past years, collimator alignments were performed semi-automatically, such that collimation experts had to be present to oversee and control the alignment. In 2018, machine learning was introduced to develop a new fully-automatic alignment tool, which was used for collimator alignments throughout the year. This paper discusses how machine learning was used to automate the alignment, whilst focusing on the operational results obtained when testing the new software in the LHC. Automatically aligning the collimators decreased the alignment time at injection by a factor of three whilst maintaining the accuracy of the results.\n",

            "We propose a novel machine-learning-based approach to detect bid leakage in first-price sealed-bid auctions. We extract and analyze the data on more than 1.4 million Russian procurement auctions between 2014 and 2018. As bid leakage in each particular auction is tacit, the direct classification is impossible. Instead, we reduce the problem of bid leakage detection to Positive-Unlabeled Classification. The key idea is to regard the losing participants as fair and the winners as possibly corrupted. This allows us to estimate the prior probability of bid leakage in the sample, as well as the posterior probability of bid leakage for each specific auction. We find that at least 16% of auctions are exposed to bid leakage. Bid leakage is more likely in auctions with a higher reserve price, lower number of bidders and lower price fall, and where the winning bid is received in the last hour before the deadline.\n",

            "Estimating the growth performance in pigs is important in order to achieve a high productivity of pig farming. We herein analyze and verify the machine learning based estimations for the growth performance in swine which includes the daily gain of body weight (DG), feed intake (FI), required growth period for growing/finishing phase (GP), and marketed-pigs per sow per year (MSY), based on the farm specific data and climate, i.e., temperature, humidity, initial age (IA), initial body weight (IBW), number of pigs (NU) and stocking density (SD). The growth data used in our work is collected from 55 pig farms which are located across South Korea for the period between October 2017 and September 2018. In the estimation of growth performance, four machine learning schemes are applied, which are the logistic regression, linear support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and random forest. Through the evaluation, we confirm that the accuracy of estimation for growth performance can be improved by 28% using machine learning techniques compared to the base line performance which is obtained by the ZeroR classifier. We also find that the accuracy of estimation is heavily dependent on the pre-process of growth data.\n",

            "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are trending topics. AI is a broad term that represents the general concept of machines being able to carry out decisionmaking and perform human-like complex tasks, such as problem solving, understanding languages, recognizing voices and images and other “smart” tasks. ML is a field of computer science that uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to “learn” with data, feeding the algorithm with a massive amount of data so that it can adjust and improve itself. ML is a specific subset of algorithms for AI. Both provide us with unbelievable advanced technology and tools to improve Health Care. The 2018 Chief Medical Officer’s report fully embraces AI and ML (Davies, 2018). It reminds us that big data and computing power to predict, and AI to diagnose and improve diagnostics, are already here. Examples of big data unique to the United Kingdom are efforts such as the 100 000 genomes and the 500 000 participants in the UK Biobank. The report advocates the embedding of these innovations to accelerate and implement of what works across England (Davies, 2018). Three areas have potential for the implementation of ML and AI within haematology. The first field could be in the form of decision support for incoming referrals to the haematologist. Intelligently designed software could guide referring clinicians, including General Practitioners and junior doctors, through an algorithm based on their initial query. Subsequently, based on their answers, incorporating patient specific data in the hospital system, it would suggest the next steps for investigation. High volume, low complex queries around, e.g. paraprotein, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, could be dealt with through this route. Only when there are pre-defined red flag signals, such as hypercalcaemia in cases with a paraprotein, red cell fragments in a case with low platelet count, blasts, or very urgent and/or complex queries, the algorithm will notify the on-call haematology team. It might, based on the complexity, also suggest that the referrer contacts the local haematology team or an (inter)national expert. This system will not be perfect the first time around, but, like a good assistant, will need to be trained. Communication could take place through innovative secure messaging applications, such as Forward (www. forwardhealth.co), enabling the exchange of patient-identifiable information, rather than old fashioned pagers or (unsafe) WhatsApp to then further distinguish urgent from nonurgent queries. Secondly, ML and AI could be used in automated blood film reporting. The initial step is to digitize all blood films, which is already technically possible. The major National Institute for Health Research bioresource hub in Milton Keynes does this on all samples processed. This is generating a vast library of normal and abnormal blood films needed for automation. In a next step, an intelligent system will also cross check clinical records, biochemistry results and pharmacy notes. In addition, it could then use pattern recognition to decide if human interference is required because it doesn’t fit any category. These films, and any set as urgent flags, would be distributed with a provisional report to yourself via email or app on your phone. All other automated reported film reports would be sent in the same way as electrocardiogram reports are sent now, but wait in a non-urgent queue on your devices. Thirdly, modelling based on large data sets could aid in prediction and risk stratification. The systems will integrate the many data points routinely collected. It could, for instance, assist in improved prediction regarding how laboratory parameters will develop, e.g. paraprotein levels and white blood counts in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). This could aid in deciding which MGUS or CML patient needs to be seen every 3 months versus every 6 months, or even every 12 months, beyond the classical markers, making more efficient use of outpatient clinic time. But also, based on data integration, it will be more accurate to predict when a patient is going to encounter complications of therapy or recover their cell counts. This will be a very useful tool to anticipate these complications and thus improve patient outcome. Despite the large potential of these techniques in haematology as sketched above, only a few papers have been published to date. A systematic literature search using the terms “Artificial intelligence”, “Haematology”, and “Hematology” revealed that in the last 5 years only 12 papers with original work have been published (L.

            "© 2018 American Physical Society. We present an accurate interatomic potential for graphene, constructed using the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) machine learning methodology. This GAP model obtains a faithful representation of a density functional theory (DFT) potential energy surface, facilitating highly accurate (approaching the accuracy of ab initio methods) molecular dynamics simulations. This is achieved at a computational cost which is orders of magnitude lower than that of comparable calculations which directly invoke electronic structure methods. We evaluate the accuracy of our machine learning model alongside that of a number of popular empirical and bond-order potentials, using both experimental and ab initio data as references. We find that whilst significant discrepancies exist between the empirical interatomic potentials and the reference data - and amongst the empirical potentials themselves - the machine learning model introduced here provides exemplary performance in all of the tested areas. The calculated properties include: graphene phonon dispersion curves at 0 K (which we predict with sub-meV accuracy), phonon spectra at finite temperature, in-plane thermal expansion up to 2500 K as compared to NPT ab initio molecular dynamics simulations and a comparison of the thermally induced dispersion of graphene Raman bands to experimental observations. We have made our potential freely available online at [http://www.libatoms.org].\n",

            "In soybean, there is a lack of research aiming to compare the performance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods to predict more than one agronomic variable, such as days to maturity (DM), plant height (PH), and grain yield (GY). As these variables are important to developing an overall precision farming model, we propose a machine learning approach to predict DM, PH, and GY for soybean cultivars based on multispectral bands. The field experiment considered 524 genotypes of soybeans in the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 growing seasons and a multitemporal–multispectral dataset collected by embedded sensor in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). We proposed a multilayer deep learning regression network, trained during 2000 epochs using an adaptive subgradient method, a random Gaussian initialization, and a 50% dropout in the first hidden layer for regularization. Three different scenarios, including only spectral bands, only vegetation indices, and spectral bands plus vegetation indices, were adopted to infer each variable (PH, DM, and GY). The DL model performance was compared against shallow learning methods such as random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and linear regression (LR). The results indicate that our approach has the potential to predict soybean-related variables using multispectral bands only. Both DL and RF models presented a strong (r surpassing 0.77) prediction capacity for the PH variable, regardless of the adopted input variables group. Our results demonstrated that the DL model (r = 0.66) was superior to predict DM when the input variable was the spectral bands. For GY, all machine learning models evaluated presented similar performance (r ranging from 0.42 to 0.44) for each tested scenario. In conclusion, this study demonstrated an efficient approach to a computational solution capable of predicting multiple important soybean crop variables based on remote sensing data. Future research could benefit from the information presented here and be implemented in subsequent processes related to soybean cultivars or other types of agronomic crops.\n",

            "Objectives Unplanned readmissions to the intensive care unit (ICU) are highly undesirable, increasing variance in care, making resource planning difficult and potentially increasing length of stay and mortality in some settings. Identifying patients who are likely to suffer unplanned ICU readmission could reduce the frequency of this adverse event. Setting A single academic, tertiary care hospital in the UK. Participants A set of 3326 ICU episodes collected between October 2014 and August 2016. All records were of patients who visited an ICU at some point during their stay. We excluded patients who were ≤16 years of age; visited ICUs other than the general and neurosciences ICU; were missing crucial electronic patient record measurements; or had indeterminate ICU discharge outcomes or very early or extremely late discharge times. After exclusion, 2018 outcome-labelled episodes remained. Primary and secondary outcome measures Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for prediction of unplanned ICU readmission or in-hospital death within 48 hours of first ICU discharge. Results In 10-fold cross-validation, an ensemble predictor was trained on data from both the target hospital and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-III) database and tested on the target hospital’s data. This predictor discriminated between patients with the unplanned ICU readmission or death outcome and those without this outcome, attaining mean AUROC of 0.7095 (SE 0.0260), superior to the purpose-built Stability and Workload Index for Transfer (SWIFT) score (AUROC=0.6082, SE 0.0249; p=0.014, pairwise t-test). Conclusions Despite the inherent difficulties, we demonstrate that a novel machine learning algorithm based on transfer learning could achieve good discrimination, over and above that of the treating clinicians or the value added by the SWIFT score. Accurate prediction of unplanned readmission could be used to target resources more efficiently.\n",

            "The Transformer translation model (Vaswani et al., 2017) based on a multi-head attention mechanism can be computed effectively in parallel and has significantly pushed forward the performance of Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Though intuitively the attentional network can connect distant words via shorter network paths than RNNs, empirical analysis demonstrates that it still has difficulty in fully capturing long-distance dependencies (Tang et al., 2018). Considering that modeling phrases instead of words has significantly improved the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approach through the use of larger translation blocks (“phrases”) and its reordering ability, modeling NMT at phrase level is an intuitive proposal to help the model capture long-distance relationships. In this paper, we first propose an attentive phrase representation generation mechanism which is able to generate phrase representations from corresponding token representations. In addition, we incorporate the generated phrase representations into the Transformer translation model to enhance its ability to capture long-distance relationships. In our experiments, we obtain significant improvements on the WMT 14 English-German and English-French tasks on top of the strong Transformer baseline, which shows the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach helps Transformer Base models perform at the level of Transformer Big models, and even significantly better for long sentences, but with substantially fewer parameters and training steps. The fact that phrase representations help even in the big setting further supports our conjecture that they make a valuable contribution to long-distance relations.\n",

            "Due to the complex interaction of urban and mountainous floods, assessing flood susceptibility in mountainous urban areas presents a challenging task in environmental research and risk analysis. Data-driven machine learning methods can evaluate flood susceptibility in mountainous urban areas lacking essential hydrological data, utilizing remote sensing data and limited historical inundation records. In this study, two ensemble learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, were adopted to assess the flood susceptibility of Kunming, a typical mountainous urban area prone to severe flood disasters. A flood inventory was created using flood observations from 2018 to 2022. The spatial database included 10 explanatory factors, encompassing climatic, geomorphic, and anthropogenic factors. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were selected for model comparison. To minimize the influence of expert opinions on model training, this study employed a strategy of uniformly random sampling in historically non-flooded areas for negative sample selection. The results demonstrated that (1) ensemble learning algorithms offer higher accuracy than other machine learning methods, with RF achieving the highest accuracy, evidenced by an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, followed by XGBoost at 0.84, surpassing both ANN (0.83) and SVM (0.82); (2) the interpretability of ensemble learning highlighted the differences in the potential distribution of the training data’s positive and negative samples. Feature importance in ensemble learning can be utilized to minimize human bias in the collection of flooded-site samples, more targeted flood susceptibility maps of the study area’s road network were obtained; and (3) ensemble learning algorithms exhibited greater stability and robustness in datasets with varied negative samples, as evidenced by their performance in F1-Score, Kappa, and AUC metrics. This paper further substantiates the superiority of ensemble learning in flood susceptibility assessment tasks from the perspectives of accuracy, interpretability, and robustness, enhances the understanding of the impact of negative samples on such assessments, and optimizes the specific process for urban flood susceptibility assessment using data-driven methods.\n",

            "Continuing progress in machine learning (ML) has led to significant advancements in agricultural tasks. Due to its strong ability to extract high-dimensional features from fruit images, deep learning (DL) is widely used in fruit detection and automatic harvesting. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) in particular have demonstrated the ability to attain accuracy and speed levels comparable to those of humans in some fruit detection and automatic harvesting fields. This paper presents a comprehensive overview and review of fruit detection and recognition based on DL for automatic harvesting from 2018 up to now. We focus on the current challenges affecting fruit detection performance for automatic harvesting: the scarcity of high-quality fruit datasets, fruit detection of small targets, fruit detection in occluded and dense scenarios, fruit detection of multiple scales and multiple species, and lightweight fruit detection models. In response to these challenges, we propose feasible solutions and prospective future development trends. Future research should prioritize addressing these current challenges and improving the accuracy, speed, robustness, and generalization of fruit vision detection systems, while reducing the overall complexity and cost.

            "In Ban and Rudin’s (2018) “The Big Data Newsvendor: Practical Insights from Machine Learning,” the authors take an innovative machine-learning approach to a classic problem solved by almost every company, every day, for inventory management. By allowing companies to use large amounts of data to predict the correct answers to decisions directly, they avoid intermediate questions, such as “how many customers will we get tomorrow?” and instead can tell the company how much inventory to stock for these customers. This has implications for almost all other decision-making problems considered in operations research, which has traditionally considered data estimation separately from the decision optimization. Their proposed methods are shown to work both analytically and empirically with the latter explored in a hospital nurse staffing example in which the best one-step, feature-based newsvendor algorithm (the kernel-weights optimization method) is shown to beat the best-practice benchmark by 24% in the out-of-sample cost at a fraction of the speed.\n",

            "Learning a faithful directed acyclic graph (DAG) from samples of a joint distribution is a challenging combinatorial problem, owing to the intractable search space superexponential in the number of graph nodes. A recent breakthrough formulates the problem as a continuous optimization with a structural constraint that ensures acyclicity (Zheng et al., 2018). The authors apply the approach to the linear structural equation model (SEM) and the least-squares loss function that are statistically well justified but nevertheless limited. Motivated by the widespread success of deep learning that is capable of capturing complex nonlinear mappings, in this work we propose a deep generative model and apply a variant of the structural constraint to learn the DAG. At the heart of the generative model is a variational autoencoder parameterized by a novel graph neural network architecture, which we coin DAG-GNN. In addition to the richer capacity, an advantage of the proposed model is that it naturally handles discrete variables as well as vector-valued ones. We demonstrate that on synthetic data sets, the proposed method learns more accurate graphs for nonlinearly generated samples; and on benchmark data sets with discrete variables, the learned graphs are reasonably close to the global optima.

This study analyzes a possible solution to the referred issue: the collection of training data from past disaster events to calibrate a discriminant function. Then the identification of affected areas in a current disaster can be performed in near real-time. The performance of a supervised machine learning classifier to learn from training data collected from the 2018 heavy rainfall at Okayama Prefecture, Japan, and to identify floods due to the typhoon Hagibis on 12 October 2019 at eastern Japan is reported in this paper. The results show a moderate agreement with flood maps provided by local governments and public institutions, and support the assumption that previous disaster information can be used to identify a current disaster in near-real time.\n",

            "The protection of user privacy is an important concern in machine learning, as evidenced by the rolling out of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU) in May 2018. The GDPR is designed to give users more control over their personal data, which motivates us to explore machine learning frameworks for data sharing that do not violate user privacy. To meet this goal, in this article, we propose a novel lossless privacy-preserving tree-boosting system known as SecureBoost in the setting of federated learning. SecureBoost first conducts entity alignment under a privacy-preserving protocol and then constructs boosting trees across multiple parties with a carefully designed encryption strategy. This federated learning system allows the learning process to be jointly conducted over multiple parties with common user samples but different feature sets, which corresponds to a vertically partitioned dataset. An advantage of SecureBoost is that it provides the same level of accuracy as the non -privacy-preserving approach while at the same time, reveals no information of each private data provider. We show that the SecureBoost framework is as accurate as other nonfederated gradient tree-boosting algorithms that require centralized data, and thus, it is highly scalable and practical for industrial applications such as credit risk analysis. To this end, we discuss information leakage during the protocol execution and propose ways to provably reduce it.\n",

            "Abstract Objective Automated clinical phenotyping is challenging because word-based features quickly turn it into a high-dimensional problem, in which the small, privacy-restricted, training datasets might lead to overfitting. Pretrained embeddings might solve this issue by reusing input representation schemes trained on a larger dataset. We sought to evaluate shallow and deep learning text classifiers and the impact of pretrained embeddings in a small clinical dataset. Materials and Methods We participated in the 2018 National NLP Clinical Challenges (n2c2) Shared Task on cohort selection and received an annotated dataset with medical narratives of 202 patients for multilabel binary text classification. We set our baseline to a majority classifier, to which we compared a rule-based classifier and orthogonal machine learning strategies: support vector machines, logistic regression, and long short-term memory neural networks. We evaluated logistic regression and long short-term memory using both self-trained and pretrained BioWordVec word embeddings as input representation schemes. Results Rule-based classifier showed the highest overall micro F1 score (0.9100), with which we finished first in the challenge. Shallow machine learning strategies showed lower overall micro F1 scores, but still higher than deep learning strategies and the baseline. We could not show a difference in classification efficiency between self-trained and pretrained embeddings. Discussion Clinical context, negation, and value-based criteria hindered shallow machine learning approaches, while deep learning strategies could not capture the term diversity due to the small training dataset. Conclusion Shallow methods for clinical phenotyping can still outperform deep learning methods in small imbalanced data, even when supported by pretrained embeddings.\n",
